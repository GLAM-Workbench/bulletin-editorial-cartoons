RAIL-HEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir Charles Metcalfe, who is leaving England for the Congo Border in connection with the further extension of the Cape to Cairo Railway, states that work on
the new section has already begun, and that 2000 tons of permanent way are being shipped weekly. Rail=head is now at Broken Hill, 375 miles north of the Victoria
Falls. It is expected that the new section will be completed this year, and that copper from the mines at Bwana Macubwa, near the frontier, will be shipped out
along the Rhodesian system before 1910 .—“Standard of Empire ” ( London) 19/3T09.
Australia’s Transcontinental Railway, constructed as far as Oodnadatta, 688 miles north of Adelaide, in 1891, is at a standstill. It has stood still for 18 years,
—Disgraceful fact
f 1 1HE Pharaohs rot in Egypt—Cleopatra’s dust is scattered,
Blown athwart the old Sahara by the sulphur-breath’d
simoon;
But I hear the fist of Progress! It has thundered, it has battered,
Rolling cataracts of mummy down the hurried slopes of doom !
Progress wins! The World is harnessed, tied with steel’s com-
pacting tether—
Past the Ganges and the Jumna swing to-day the freighted cars;
Where Zambesi’s storied waters plunge them down to regions
nether,
Flames the white Man’s engine-furnace splashing night with
funnelled stars !
Forward still —beyond Mozuma, past the Gwaai and Batoka,
Hauling fish-plates, dragging dog-spikes up the long Malundu
Hills;
Freight for Rail-Head. Hear the driver, likewise listen to the
stoker—
Space expires and Doubt collapses when the earnest White man
wills !
Shifting Rail-Head ever onwards towards old Memphis and
Assouan—
Drives his track for ever forward, wins his battle mile by mile ;
While the bones of Amenhotep moulder on in silent ruin,
He is reaching out for Cairo and he hustles towards the Nile !
Given lands to rule and work for—given strength that we may
use it,
Lo, we sleep beside our Rail-Head partly buried in the sand ;
We are careless of our Birthright, so we spurn it and refuse it,
And the hammer-haft has fallen from Australia’s nerveless
hand. - '
Yet _ the Heritage is calling: “Shift your Rail-Head, shift it
faster ;
Drive the spikes and bolt the fish-plates, wield the crowbar and
the drill;
Link your Northland to your Southland lest ye waken ’mid
disaster—
See! Thy kinsman moves his Rail-Head from his distant
Broken Hill!
“ He is reaching out for Empire ; he is ever forward shifting,
He is toiling while ye slumber, sleeping precious years away;
On your broken road pile sand-drifts that the cynic winds are
lifting,
For the winds that scattered Pharaoh mock this sleeping land
to-day !
Wake, my people, wake and labor! Toil with hammer and
with spanner—
Be not laggards all and shiftless, paralysed in brain and thevv.
Lift the fallen Flag of Progress—raise the White Man’s proud
old banner,
Shift your Rail-head, shift it nor’ward. Face your Task and
See It Through.”
VICTORIA.

Reid says he can’t get enough sneaks and spies to properly carry o’ 7
closing law.
MR. WANT’S RETURN.
“ The Premier hopes that his late Attorney-General will not
further complicate matters for the Government by coming back pre-
cipitately and emphasising his opposition to the decisions of the Pre- .
miers’Conference. Mr. Reid thinks that Mr. Wants health wfll
preclude an early departure from London. Another reason that m-
duces the Premier to imagine
'that his late colleague will
prolong his stay in the old
land is the fact that in ""con-
nection with a mining venture
in Queensland, Mr. Want has,
it is stated, succeeded in sud-
denly amassing a fortune of be-
tween £30,000 and £40,000.
“ Prince Henry of Prussia, who was present at
the launch of the North German Lloyd Company’s
new steam tender at Shanghai, «met with an acci-
dent as the vessel was leaving the ' ways.” The
order was given to release the ‘ dogs,’ when a large
piece of wood fell from the vessel’s bows, striking
the Prince on the head. He entered into the sub-
sequent proceedings with appacent unconcern. ’
Chorus op Deacons : “ J think we could get a few ! ”
The Sydney Daily Telegraph has got it bad. Here is the
fragment of a wail clipped’ from a recent issue of that sorely-tried
journal :
THE ATTORNEY • GENERAL.
The Premier is in no hurry to fill the vacancy caused by the resigna-
tion of Mr. Want. Mr. Reid says the public may be definitely informed
that nothing will be done in the matter
“ for some time to come.” What*
however, if the Premier secret-
ly anticipates that Mr.
Want, when the present
trouble is settled for good
or evil, will wander hack to
the fold 1 Mr. Want has
done it before why not,
again ? There are prob-
done it before ; why not
again ? There arc prob-
cedure.
It really looks as if the
anti-Billious party were,
generally speaking, “prob-
done ”
Arch-destroying Angel : “ Alas ! my bleed-
ing country. Fain would I fly to her assistance
in this her hour of peril ; but owing to the present
State of my health ” (patting his pockets) “1 >

WHAT ANTI-FEDERALISTS ARE TRYING TO PERPETUATE.
“ General ” Booth says he does not yet despair of saving the politicians, especially
those hardened sinners, Iteid and Dibbs.

In consequence of the outbreak of ticks at Brisbane a pro-
clamation was issued in a supplement to the “ Government Gazette ” yesterday ab-
solutely prohibiting for a period of six months the introduction or importation by
land or sea of any cattle or horses from the following portion of the province of Queens-
land : —“ On the west by the 148th meridian ;on the north by the present quaran-
tine line, as proclaimed on February 25, 1898; on the east by the Pacific Ocean;
and on the south by the boundary dividing the provinces of New South Wales and
Queensland.”
All the same, the ticks will manage to evade the law somehow.

“ Mr. Reid (the Premier), who was received
with loud applause, expressed the great
pleasure which he felt at being the guest of
the association. There was one matter in
which Mr. Lyne, Mr. Copeland, and himself,
although bitter political opponents, had stood
side by side, and that was the. determination
that the licensing trade of this country should
receive something like fair play. (Cheers.)

THE DAILY TELEGI
A sensible innovation Is to be Introduced la the new
Anglican church to be built at Murrumbeena. The com-
mittee has decided that up-to-date punkahs, worked by
water-power, will be fitted up in the building. It is Intended
that these will be worked on all hot days on which meetings
and are held in the church.

JOURNALISM UP TO DATE.
(Trusting to a rather bad memory, our artist transcribes this “feature” from
the N.S.W. daily press.)
Two views of a house where a gentle kanaka, employed as a servant, closed
his engagement by strangling the entire family. The cross (X* see No. 1)
marks the look-out on the roof where the miscreant used to retire to mature
the plans for his Intended crime over a pipe. The two chimneys (see No. 2),
Indicated by two crosses (XX)» were stuffed with sofa-pillows, left-off clothing
and things, to prevent the shrieks of his victims from being heard outside.
You see the triangle (&) marked on the end of the wing of the building, don't
you ? Well, that Isn’t where the crime was committed, but in the cellar Just
beneath. (Keep this In mind, It’s Important.) A littlf to the right of tho
picture Is seen a policeman, who was telephoned for and called a few days
after the funeral of the victims. Seeing the sign up, “TO LET”, he fired a
few shots at the house (for revolver practice) and left. (It will be observed
there are no crosses on the bouse marking bullet-holes.)

fore his lamented death by

Scepticism Thwarted.
Such Daily and Hourly Proof Must
Convince all Unbelievers.
Th« Can of Hr. JAMtS WIHCFItID.
(BY Ji SYDNEY SCEIB*.)
What with the seven years’ drought, a re-
currence of the plague in our midst and
.hocks of earthquake in various parts of the
country,it is high time that a definite policy
f &r purposes of personal defence should be
dopted and although there are some
elements of disaster which cannot be re-
sisted it is no reason why we should not
make the most of the opportunities at our
disposal for overcoming some of them.
Fflective aid in the shape of advice is given
below by Mr. James Wingfield, of ho. 14
Garden Avenue, Glebe, who says :
“When I came from the country seven years
gaol was down for eighteen months with
inflammation of the lungs and pneumonia.
4Jy constitution was fairly bioken up, as for
aearly three years I was not able to do a
stroke of work, and, of course, that meant
everything going out and 1 ot dug coming
in The consequence was tl at as toon as I
coaid cret about at all I took the first job
available. The work was heavy—much too
heavy for me, in fact—so that what little
strength I had was soon exhausted ; but it
was not until I severely strained my back
tbac I realised the great risk I bad been
running Following closely upon that mis-
jj 3 p ( I caught a terrible cold in the kidneys,
which, in turn, was attended by an awful
attack of influenza, thus showing how ona
misfortune follows another. I managed to
jog along in extreme difficulties until the in-
fluenza came, but that proved too much for
me altogether, as I went right under as
#oon as it seized me.”
“ Was it necessary to take to your bed ? ”
asked the pi essman.
“ Rather.. ‘ The pains in my head were
lo intense that I could not hold it up, and
my temperature rose to an alarming degree.
My back ached worse than ever, while my
limbs were so much affected in the same
way that I could not get any ease no matter
in what position I lay. Supervening upon
thoso tortures came a burning pain in my
eyes, over which I had two bandages placed,
and also one around my forehead, to see if
my agony could be reduced. I must have
looked as if I had been at the Boer war,
but I can tell you it was no laughing matter,
for 1 could neither eat nor sleep, and I
deeply regretted to find that the cold was
getting on my chest, which became clogged
up during the night, and in the morning, as
loon as daylight came, I started to cough,
and a very heavy feeling oppressed me till
I got my chest cleared again. However, I
have to be very thankful that at the critical
moment, when there was every likelihood of
a prolonged and calamitous illness being
again experienced, I resorted to a medicine
which had previously enlisted my implicit
confidence, as, by its timely use, the im-
pending destruction was averted. To be
explict, I must tell you that after my ill-
ness with pneumonia I took to using
Clements Tonic for the purpose of recuperat-
ing my vitality, and I met with so much
•access through the revivifying powers of
that medicine that I naturally looked to it
to strengthen me again. But Clements
Tonic had a chance of doing more this time,
and it was quite equal to the occasion. You
**e, when I was lying prostrate with in-
fluenza I did not waste much time before
getting Clements Tonic, and thus that
dreadful complaint was held in check. My
excruciating head pains were very shortly
relieved, and the agonising manner in which
my eyes were affected wasgreatly minimised.
The wonderful relief I then felt through
the agency of Clements Tonic helped me
along considerably, and as my strength was
gradually improving '-under the same
remedy, so was ther e rvfore vital power in
my system to fight against my adversities.”
“You mean,” said the reporter, “that
your disease made no further headway.”
“ Exactly,” waa the enthusiastic reply.
11 It was like a pitched battle between two
gladiators, and there is no doubt that
Clements I onic won easily, as it prevented
the cold from getting a further hold upon
my chest, and the heaviness and difficulty
in breathing were entirely removed. I
used to think that I had lost control of my
nerves complettly, because they trembled
so whenever anything happened to excite
me, and, besides, I got irritat le at the least
thing. If I chanced to hear anybody
whistling or singing I felt annoyed, for it)
seemed that everybody could be
happy hub myself, and that is a very
melancholy frame of mind to be in, believe
m\ But the Clements Tonic I was taking
quickly held the upper hand over these
troubles, for my nervous system was re-
stored to order, and the general sense of
ease and comfort which I was gaining had
the effect of making my mind more peaceful
and contented. The awful complication of
complaints from which I had suffered had
made such a wreck of me that I could nob
get quite strong for some time, as, in the
meanti re, I felt languid and drowsy all
day, and with my limbs for ever aching;
but it wa3 a grand thing that Clements
Tonic had gone so far as to make me well
enough to go back to my woik, although for
a while I felt very exhausted when I came
home at nights, and was always glad wl.«n
Sundays came round.”
“ Were you resting better then than
before ?”
“ Ob, yes. I found that Clements Tonio
was a fine medicine for making me sleep,
and I was pleased to fed refreshed and
active when I woke up. because I had pre-
viously been put to such distress on getting
out of bed that 1 had to straighten myself
gradually on account of the pains in my
back, which at last yielded to the curative
properties of Clements Tonic, like the reib
of the miseries which I had suffered from.
After a certain period my shattered con-
stitution was properly welded together
again, and whenever I have been asked how
it was done my friends have always received
the same reply- through using Clements
Tonic, and so long as I live it will be a
pleasure for me to advise all sufferers to
take the same medicine for curing thtic
complaints. Focd had to be very tempt-
ing, and eve 1 then I could notalways touch ib
befoie taking to Clements Tonic, but after-
wards I felt so hungry that I could take a fair
quantity of any kind of food, and thoroughly
enjoy it. Moreover, my digestive organs
were so benefi.ed by the use of Clements
Tonic, that the assimilation of my food
followed as a matter of course, and
I suppose that is one of the princi-
pal reasons why flatulence, headaches,
body pains, giddiness, and other physical
defects do not trouble me now.”
“ Have you any objection to this stats*
ment being published ? ”
f ‘ Not the slightest. You can publish
these words of gratitude to Clements
Tonic in any way you may prefer.”

The latest manifestation of this
’Anglo-American amicableness is made in the
semi-official announcement that the Govern-
ment of the . United States only remains
neutral with respect to the British-Boer war
so long as no other Power interferes between
the combatants. The meaning of this is,
assumedly, that if another Power does inter-
fere the United States will claim a right to
come into the quarrel and see that Britain
gets fair play—in other words, that she may

Every gurgling gutter surges;
Fate and weather
Linked together
Lashing me with whips and scourges.
Black the night and chill the wind;
Never outlook seemed forlorner.
Rain and thunder—
Yet I wonder
What is waiting round yon corner!
Throtigh the blackness where I crouch,
Through the dark, despairful hollow,
Gleams a far light
Clear as starlight.
Hope men name it. Dare I follow?

“CUCKOO!”
""He could say fearlessly that, far from there being any sort of rivalry between him and the venerable gentleman, he was prepared, so long as Sir Henry Parkes
was connected with public life—so long as he was well and strong enough to undertake the duties and cares of leadership-he (Mr. Reid) was ready to accept and
follow that leadership.”— G. H. Reid, at the N.S.W Commercial Traveller s’ dinner.
“It is well known that the cuckoo does not make any nest of its own but places its egg in the nest of some small bird such as the hedge-warbler or the pied wag
tail. The little bird does not detect the imposition but hatches the interloper together with her own young. The mother meanwhile sits by uttering her monotonous
“cuckoo—cuck-oo."" —Natural History.

Privilege of Shooting Deer.
It was announced a few days ago that an
exalted personage had shot two deer at Cress-
brook. On inquiry in official quarters we
leani that “ permission ” has been
given to the gentleman in question to shoot
three deer. It will be interesting to
many who were enthusiastic in promot-
ing the introduction of deer and other
game, to learn who, save an absolute
and undisputed owner, has power to
grant “permission.”

A DOMESTIC EPISODE WITH AN ALL-AUSTRALIAN APPLICATION.
N.S.W. State Premier Wade and the Sydney
Water and Sewerage Board are still rolling over
and over on the floor, discussing the question of
another 57 square miles of catchment area which
the Board says is urgently required to guarantee
Sydney against water famine. Wade declares,
while the two authorities scrap fiercely with their
heads under the grate, that he will use the place
for a benevolent institution and consumptives’
hospital, and that Sydney must look elsewhere for
water; and the Board, while fighting a desperate
rear-guard action in the coal-scuttle, asserts that
Wade does this sort of thing with a mere view to
being, nasty. Anyhow, when Sydney itself can’t
get a small question of a water reservation fixed
without all this bitter scrimmage, the Australian
Parliament had better make dead sure that the
whole water-supply of the Federal capital is under
its own control. The Federal capital would
almost certainly have a far worse experience than
Sydney, if it depended on the State Government,
and would have to scuffle a lot harder for a drink.

Has got it in for me. Speak, worthy sage!

By which I mean: What hope is there for Me?
AUGUR: —
The sparrow, Caesar, which, in thoughtless wise,
Lights on a volted switch flares up and dies.
The switch that on your prospects put the lid
Was charged with five-and-twenty thousand quid.
You touched it and instanter all was o’er;
Singed to the pelt you fluttered to the floor.
Cease this pretence of life: ’tis all in vain.

THE GATHERING OF THE CRIMINALS.
A deputation of fruitgrowers recently waited on Customs Minister Lyne to complain that, under his Commerce Act, restrictions are placed on
the trade in diseased fruit. The Bulletin hears on bad authority that next time the fruitgrowers call to complain because they are not allowed
to poison the community they will be supported by other influential offenders—especially representatives of the Burglars’ Federation, the United
Embezzlers, and the Baby-Farmers’ Union. William is again expected to be unsympathetic.

REID’S ARMY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In his speech on the naval and military defence of Aus-
tralia, last night, Mr. G. H. Reid, M.P., clearly indicated
that the true solution of the problem of compulsory ser-
vice was to be found in the school playgrounds. “ Compel
our schoolboys,” he said, “ to be taught the rudiments of
military drill. —Daily Paper.
Who is the Spartan fierce that stands
With waving gamp upon the sands,
The children crowded round his knee
Beside the damp and mournful scat
Who is the man with tight-shut lips
Who gazes at the foeman’s ships,
Who wears no sword and grips no gun t
Who is this brave contemptuous one t
The lean gray cruiser on the swell
Waits but the word to vomit H — l;
Her gun-crews whisper each to each:
“ Who is the bloke upon the beach t”
Alas, the gunners cannot see
Australia's champion—Reid ! ’Tis HE
Who leads, with loud potential whoops,
Our stickjaw, kindergarten troops!

Morbid Months of Misery
“A DESPAIRING WRECK OF HUMANITY.”
A Great Friend Sri Time of EMeed
rue Case of U[r. H. B H'dlT.
(by a special reporter.)
It is worthy of note that the interviews
which have from time to time appeared in
these columns are singularly free from mere
theorising about the subjects dealt with,
and are entirely confined to piactical, though
none the less interesting, details, an addition
to which is made by Henry Barnett, of No.
212 James-street, Leichhardt.
“ To show what important events some
times arise from trivial causes,” said the
gentleman mentioned, “ I must inform you
that one day I scratched my elbow wiih a
piece of zinc, which was hanging loosely in-
side a waggon. It was nothing to grow
alarmed about, I thought, and 1 took no
notice of it until the next day, when my
arm appeared to be slightly inflamed, but I
did not take any precaution to stop it get-
ting any worse. Not till a week afterwards
did I bother myself and by that time my
arm was so much swollen, and the pain was
so intense, that I could not go any longer
without seeking some advice.”
“ V\ here did you go for it?” the .repor-
ter enquired.
“ To the hospital, and on three successive
visits my arm was operated upon. It was
then that I realised the great disaster which
had overtaken me, as the doctor said I had
just come in time to save losing my life from
blood poisoning, so by that you will know
that I was in a dreadful state.”
“ Were you able to attend to your busi-
ness ? ”
“Work of any description was beyond
my powers for nearly four months, for my
constitution was fairly broken up and I was
almost helpless. This being the first illness
I ever had, you may depend that I felt my
misfortune very keenly, and the thought
that I would never be a >le to use my arm
again nearly drove me frantic. I sat and
brooded over my troubles till my mind
lapsed into a chronic state of despondency,
and although the doctor said I had come
‘just in time,’ I did not feel so sure about
it, as I felt so generally weak and wretched
that I doubted if I could survive the terrible
calamity which had occurred. For five
days and nights I did not eat a morsel of
food, although I tried hard enough to take
a little nourishment, but I could not swal-
low what I put to my mouth, and this, to-
gether with the agonising pains I was
suffering, made a thorough wreck of me.
My cruel tortures would not allow me to
sleep, neither did I know which way to lie
for ease, so that when daylight came I was
glad to got up in spite of having scarcely
sufficient st> ength to walk about, for if I
did \aaks an attempt my lread turned so
giddy that X si-xi had to sit down again.
My wife was kept gon.o ;.v?yht ami day bath-
ing and bandaging Tny arm, hut even the
great care I received and the doct ors medi-
cines combined cou d not succeed in elimi-'
nating the pois n which prevented the
wound from healing. I was completely at
the mercy of my original complaint, which in
time made my recovery more improbable,
because of the run it wrought on my in-
ternal organs, and as ailment after ailment
was piled up I saw that my prospects were
more gloomy than ever. My nerves were
always on the quiver, which showed that
the strain on my system was too great for
them, and I felt particularly m rvous on
hearing any noises, which also grated on my
ears and made me extremely irritable. I
could see that it was no good taking any
more doctor’s medicines, as I was getting no
benefit from them and they made me feel
sick; besides, they did not help me in re-
gard to my appe.ite, so I decided on pur-
chasing some Clements Tonic.”
“ How did that idea originate ?
“ Well, I had taken Clements Tonic to
give me an appetite once before w hen I was
fseling a bit jaded, and it made me eat like
a horse ; and now that I was so feeble, and
run down as low as I could be, I thought
Clements Tonic might do the same again.
And, upon my word, it did ; but for a while
I was sorry that Clements Tonic made me
eat so heartily, as my digestive organs were
in such a shockingly bad state that all food
disagreed with me. My stomach always
got filled"" with wind, and iny chest pains
were so weighty that I could scarcely get
my breath, while the awful pains 1 had
hitherto been maddened with were added
to by something going wrong between my
shoulders. The taste mmy mouth and the
furred condition of my tongue testified to
the disordered state of mv liver, but the
aches in my limbs and across my loins told
the direful tale that my vita'ity was per-
fectly exhausted. When I come to look
back upon those weeks of abject orture and
misery, when I could not even read for the
swollen feeling in my eyes, with no anima-
tion in my body, and with no hope left, I
consider it a merciful of
Providence which influenctd me to perse-
vere with Clements Tonic, by the aid of
which came a delightful experience that
broke the morbid monotony of all those
months. When the first bott'e of Clements
Tonic was finished I was sleeping more
soundly than I had done for some time past,
the reason being that there was a decrease
in the pains which had kept me awake so
consistently, and how thankful I was for
the rest, too ! To find that I could obtain
rtlief from Clements Tonic gave me a fresh
interest in life, although I did not antici-
pate throwing off my afflictions altogether,
as they had held out so obstinately against
other medicines ; hut I was grateful for all
mercies, and when the discomforts following
my meals were lessened you can imagine
my great surprise. Little by little my
strength returnc d, and the vitalizing pro-
petties-of Clements Tonic came in evidence
by the gradual healing of the wound in my
arm, and now there is nothing but a scar to
show where it was opened. I had lost a
considerable amount of flesh during my
illness, but in a few weeks it w ; as all re-
stored, so it,is needless to say that < lements
Tonic put my digestive organs in thorough
order, besides infusing so much power to my
nervous system that you could not have got
a tremble out of my nerves no matter how
you might have tried. Before long I had
shaken off every pain that had tormented me,
and with the full complement of strength
which Clements Tonic restor ed to my sys-
tem, I went I ack to work none the worse
for the terrible trials I had undergone.”
“ Are you sure you were quite cured ?”
“ I have not had t e least thing wrong
with me since, and I feel as hearty as though
my constitution were made of iron, so
Clements Tonic did its work well. I was
a despairing wreck of humanity when it
was calle 1 into requisition, and for saving
me as it did I owe my life—long thanks to
Clements Tonic—an ado ission which you
can publish in any way that may do good.”

preaching the other evening at a. special service
at St. Thomas’ Church of England, North Syd-
ney, the Rev. W. I. Carrrpnjith said that aurhiß
the recent period of wet weather the chiirches bmh
been pretty nearly empty) • Under ordinary cir-j
cumetances, he waa sorry to observe, the bulk of
Congregations consisted of ladies, the men being
for .'the most part conspicuous by their absence.
Eut when the rain fell ladles did not care to risk
theit wood dresses and hats, and as they would
not be' seen at church in anything else, they
stayed away. He was afraid, indeed, that many
attended only in order to show their nicest appa-.
. tef. ’That, in hlB opinion, was the esplanation
of the sparsdness of the cbngrcgatlOßs'dnring' the
last few Veeks.

been courting death by poison.
Throughout the recent wet winter a popular and
effective remedy for coughs and throat affections
IWas what are known as liquorice, linseed, and
; chlorodyne lozonges. r
At the Control Summons Court yesterday tho
Inspector of the Pharmacy Board proceeded!
against two city confectioners for breaches of the
Solspos Act, the defendants not being licensed to
MW v t>oi*bn. The information stated that these
lozenges contained poison—to wit, <ihloro-
lornL. . Dr. ‘William Hamlet, Government
Analyst . gave evidence that the lozenges con-
tained. jSg&it two-elevenths of a grain of chloro-
'ipumf-of-about three.:minims. The maximum
a«se .of chloroform woiild be five, minims.-' He
considered them to be dangerous, and, in his
opinion, half-a-dozen of them might kill a
child. Mr. Wllshite, 8.M., fined each of tho
defendants £l, with costs. So in future it may
be assumed, that confectioners’ stocks will not
fcaclhde these -tasty articles.

The Vagaries of a Torpid Li V er.
A Useful Lesson for Sufferers*
The Case of Wlr. J. DECNAN.
fFOR THB “ REDFERN TIMES.”)
Among the most impor'ant missions of
inquiry placed on record was that recently
made by our reporter to the home of Air.
Joi n Degnan, Garden-street, North Botany,
ibis is due as much to tlie magn tude of his
discoveries as to the interest of the incident
he elicited on inquiring.
“.Will yon favour me with a complete
outline of the vicissitudes you successfully
combated ? ”
“ Right willingly,” answered Mr. Deg-
uan, as he offered the pressman a seat. Five
years went by from the time my illness
staited till it was finally conquered, and if
I did not have a bad time it was a caution.
Bear in mind, it was all through the torpid
state of my liver, and, beliexe me, 1 got
into such a very wretched condition that I
did not care whether I lived or not. Before
I was really aware what cisaster was be-
falling me I used to feel as though I had no
life in me, and was always low-spirited and
sleepy. There was only one thing that I
w r as fit for, and that was to lie down, but
when I did so I could not sleep, my mind
being actively engaged in going through a
multitude of unhappy thoughts which
seemed to be bom of the melancholy condi-
tion I was in. What caused me considerable
uneasiness of mind was that my appetite
became poorer every day, and still more
anxiety was engendered by the knowledge
that what food I did eat was of no benefit
to me, my ability to digest any kind of
eatables ba\ing vanished. In this way it
transpired that my strength wasted away
till it was often conq ulsory for me to knock
off work, although n y employment at that
time was not of a heavy description.”
“ How did you feel after your meals? ”
“Just as if I had swallowed so much
lead. S< mething like a heavy ball seemed
to foim in my stomach, the pains arising
from which were simply horrible, aud from
the stomach the heavy sensations travelled
up to my chest, thereby giving me extra-
ordinary difficulty in breathing. My head
ached to a degree which proved almost dis-
tracting, for I could not settle down to
read or do anything, and there w ; as even a
swollen feeling in my eyes to annoy me.
Owing to a pricking sensation under my
shoulder-blades I used to think I had
caught a cold, but experience has taught
me that that was a derangul liver symptom,
while another one, although more torment-
ing in its persislency, was a nasty aching
pain across the loins, which I felt very dis-
tinctly whei\ .lioving about. The bitter
taste in my mouth was enough to turn any
man off his food, and the dirty coating on
my tongue used to make me feel sick. At
times, when exhausted naturo claimed a
few hours’rest, I fell as’eep, but there was
no comfort in doing so, as the ugly diearns
I had simply beggar description. The flesh
gradually fell away from my frame till my
benes were quite \ it ible, ancl my prospects
were anything but rosy, especially as my
head had long since been troubles! me.
W ithout any ostensible reason it used to
start beating violently against my ribs, the
sound it made being quite loud enough to
bo heard several yards away. It seemed
more than likely that my heart was diseased,
particularly so as those fits of palpitation
were usually accompanied by feelings of
faintness. The woi ry of mind and pain of
body at last succeeded in wearing out my
patience, for it took but little to make me
irritable and excited, after which I sank
into the old gloomy groove of misery till
something else occun ed to upset me. Ner-
vousness was not the least of my ailments,
as my nerves twitched involuntarily when-
ever anything happened to disturb me, and
in spite of the mtdicines I had taken, they
-till trembled at the least provocation.”
“ YVheie did you get your medicine from,
Mr. Degnan?”
“I refer to the medicines which my
doctors prescribed for me, but which I
aright as well have left untouched for all the
good they were. I was Iwaya paying
money away to doctors, and never got any
value hack for it; but now if I should
have the ill-luck to fall into bad health
agam I would go straight for Clements
ionic, as I know it to be the bist medicine
ever brought within the reach of suffering
humanity.”
“ r J hat being your opinion, why did you
not take some earlier than you did ? ”
“ Recause I h-d been suffering five years
before I was told about Clements Tonic,
and another reason w as because I had de-
cided against taking any more medicine, as
I thoinht it was useless. But a relative
came upon the scene and told me how
Clenunts Tonic had cuied Ids complaints,
which were like mine in nearly evety detail;
so I promised to try it, and when I did so
it was the best diy’s work I ever did, for
Clements Tonic piloted me to health. I
used to dread the very idea of taking any
food, but when I had been on Clements
Tonic a few days it was quite different, ss I
was always the first to sit down to meals
and the last one to finish eating, and before
a week was over there was a great reduc-
tion in the severity of my pains in the
stomach. My food did not ferment and
turn to wind as in former years, but it
digested quite readily, and of course I got
the benefit of its nourishment The weary
feelings which had darkened my days were
wafted away by the invigorating qualities
of Clements Tonic, which likewise buckled
together my shattered nerves and male
them firm and true. The greatest srrprise
I ever got in my life was when I discovered
what a splendid medicine Clements Toidc
was for promoting healthful sleep, and I
say ‘healthful’ advisedly, for there was no
languidness or depression on awaking, s’ich
as is experienced after taking sleeping
draughts or other such means for producing
slumber. The anxious misgivings which I
had borne in silence when my heart was
given to palpitating were not long in being
dispelled, for Clements Tonic made that
organ beat with the regularity of a clock,
and I can make the same statement in
regard to my internal functions generally,
for I never suffered from constipation after
taking a few bottles of Clements Tonic,
which relieved my chest pains and head-
aches very easily. It was pleasant to get
up and notice that my tongue was clean and
that the biiter taste had left my mouth,
but what was still more to be appreciate!
was the fact that every ache and pain had
deserted my body, which was regaining ita
weight from day to day.”
“ Are you sure about the completeness of
your cure ? ”
“I am quite positive that Clements Tonio
made a new man of me by giving me better-
health and more strength than I ever had
before. Not long sgo I was helping to cut a
road through the mountains, about ten miles
from Nowra, and I found that I conld do
the heaviest manual labour going without
being unduly fatigued, and, as Clements
Tonic gave me the health to do it, you cau
publish my story in any way you want.”

FREE CURE.
Wonderful Home Treatment that Cures
Without Pain or Loss of Time.
Dr. W. S. Rice (Dept. 1317), 8 & 9, Stonecutter
Street, London, E.C., has invented a method that
cures rupture without pain, danger, operation, or
an hour’s loss of time from the day’s work. To
avoid all questions of doubt, he
sends free to every sufferer a
free trial of his method, and
there can be no earthly reason
why anyone, rich or poor, should
not avail themselves of this
generous offer. As an instance
of this remarkable method,
the cure of Mr. J. J. Hogan,
Cobar, N.S.W., is well worth
noticing. He was cured at the
age of 70 years, after suffering
10 years. He made an affidavit
to ihis effect, of his own free
Mn.A. Dochertv. wi n, be f o re Wo J.P’s.
Mr. J. Kubank, a farmer of Yarloop, Western
Australia, was cured after suffering 48 years from
a scrotal rupture. Mrs. F. Medley, 177, Sturt
Street, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, was cured
after suffering 5 years. Mr. A. Docberty, 23, War-
wick Street, Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, was
cured of an irreducible scrotal rupture—one of the
worst kinds known. No treatment he had used
would enable him to return the rupture to its
proper place. He tried the method of Dr. Rice,
which not only reduced the rupture, but also
effected its comp'ete cure, and he is now as sound
as a bell. A full description and sample of this
remarkable method of cure will be gladly sent
upon application. It has cured the usands. Do not
hesitate to pive it a trial. Wr'tc at once —to-day.

Maloney's
Cockatoo
’Twas in a river bend I met, not far from Byanbye,
An ancient man of bitter speech, with murder in his eye.
His gaze was lifted heavenward, where in the taller trees
A band of drowsy cockatoos were perched in noonday ease.
“I’d like to choke the cows,” he said, “their flamin’ necks to screw!
There ain’t a curse on all the earth to beat a cockatoo.”
The hush of noon was on the land. The stream that wimpled there
Was murmuring a soft refrain; the balmy, scented air
Might well all angry thoughts assuage, dispel all passions wild—
Alas, the hour impressed him not! His eloquence defiled
The sylvan solitude; until at last from him I drew
The reason why he had a curse for ev’ry cockatoo.
“Just forty year ago it was I had a slap-up team
Of bullicks cartin’ stores an’ wool along the Darling stream.
Yes; four-an-’twenty of the best. I was a big gun then—
Could fill ’em up, an’ speak me turn with any class o’ men.
I was a cove as gained respect wherever bullicks grew—
Until my life was blighted by a flamin’ cockatoo.
“I’d loaded up at Bogaduk with stores from off the boat;
Then, feelin’ sort o’ parchecj inside, I thought I’d damp my throat.
I left the bullicks on the road, contented in their yokes;
But in Maloney’s bar I met a lot o’ station blokes,
Old friends o’ mine. The drinks went round the way they useter
do—
I never thought no mischief from Maloney’s cockatoo.
“He was an edjercated bird you know the sort maybe—
Could sing an* whistle, curse an’ swear the same as you an’ me.
Well, as we downed our drinks an’ laughed an’ talked the time away,
A lady friend o’ mine come in, excited like, to say:
‘Hey, Bill, you blanky fool,’ she says, ‘come out, an’ lively, too —
Your blanky team’s been started by that flamin’ cockatoo!’
“ 'Struth, she was right! Along the track through clouds of dust
they showed,
With Cocky on the waggon perched. We sprinted down the road;
An’ drawin’ nearer heard him shout, like one who knew the trade:
‘Gee-orf, you crimson crocodiles!’ The cranky cows obeyed!
‘Gee-orf!’. . . . While we was still behind we seen the leaders slew
Right over to the river bank—drove by that cockatoo!
“ ‘Gee-orf!’ The waggon with a rush went rollin’ down the bank,
Draggin* me bullicks in with it; beneath the stream it sank;
I watched the bubbles risin’, as I leaned against a post,
Where Spot an’ Brindle an’ the rest was givin’ up the ghost.
One livin’ thing alone escaped. High in the air it flew
In screechin’ triumph to the pub—Maloney’s cockatoo!
“That broke me ’eart!"" The ancient raised his eyes aloft once more;
And in the mellow afternoon blood-curdling oaths he swore.
The sweet blush blooms were round his feet—he took no heed of
these,
But wished that he had wings to reach “them blankers in the trees.”
So from that sylvan solitude I turned and bade adieu
To one whose life was blighted by a soulless cockatoo!
MAORILAND.

THE PHANTOM OF THIN PLATES AND FAT DIVIDENDS.
(1) Lhyps trading on the A .S.W. coast are inspected every 12 months. (2) A sworn statement made before a Royal Commission was to the effect that
under certain circumstances, vessels working bar harbors might wear their plates to the extent of one-eighth of an inch in six months. (3)Some vessels
employed m the coastal trade are said to have plates three-sixteenths of an inch thick. — Three Startling Facts.
[For Tiik Bulletin.]
Beyond the silent headlands, by islet, rock and cape,
In flying scud and cloud drift they see that dreadful shape;
It rides upon the tempest, it sits “the bucking gale,
A horror drawn in darkness-against the morning pale.
V\ orse than the wrath that thundered above Ulysses’ crew,
More than the flaming whiskers Thor’s awful visage grew,
Sterner than Jove’s red lightning that split the ebon sky,
That ponderous doom that follows the ships that go to die.
Bell-toppered through the darkness, large-waisted through the storm,
Rolls o er the black sea’s anger that round, enormous form;
At rest on cloudy cushions, where late the sea Pates sat,
The shipmen see with anguish the awful shape of Pat.
By rock, and cape, and islet the, winds his wreckage spread,
His flabby hand with corpses the sickened deep has fed;
Insured/gainst wrath and tempest, what should he reek of sin,
Who makes black death his partner to rake his shekels in?
The thin steel from his forges grinds on the river bar,
The worn plates meet the surges in endless sweep and jar,
The cheap decks reel and shudder above the wide sea grave,
With racing engines chanting Fat’s mercy on the wave.
The loud seas shriek in triumph, the broken rivets start,
ith groan of rending metal the wide seams gape apart;
Death laughs—the black night closes—another vessel gone—
The nine days 5 wonder passes—Fat and his sea roll on.
Beyond the lighted headland, in calm and shouting storm,
The ship-men see in vision that round, enormous form—
\\ ho cares ? The plates rust thinner to match their owner’s need.
And cold white faces waver amid the swaying weed.
Ks.w.

A Lesson Worth Learning.
Hsepatitis and Dyspeptic Misery.
“A BLESSING TO WORK & LIVE,”
The Case of
Mrs. B. EAGAR.
(For the Redfern Times.)
It is impossible to read the following
statement of the condition of things de-
scribed by Mrs. Bertha Eagar, of No. 145
Walker-street, Redfern, without being
struck by certain phases and facts in her re-
Gital. Carrying her memory back eleven
years, Mrs. Eagar said :
“ It is that length of time since I was re-
leased from a complaint of such great ob-
stinacy that there was every reason to think
I would never be the same woman again.
Why I say this is because my sufferings ex-
tended over a period of six months or
more, and half that time I was under the
care of a doctor.”
“ What complaint was he treating you
for?” asked our reporter.
“ My ailments were as numerous as they
were difficult to cope with, but I am of
opinion that they were occasioned by a dis-
eased state of my liver. Be that as it may,
I know that indigestion was one of the prin-
cipal features of my illness, and I became so
seriously affected by it that before long I
was a completely helpless invalid. When I
had been taking medicines prescribed by my
physician till I knew it was useless to drink
any more I did not know what to do next,
for I was so feeble that I could not walk
across the floor. It seemed a cruel thing to
throw so much money away, and waste so
much time for nothing, but when people are
ill, you know, they will spend their last
penny, if necessary, in buying things which
they expect to do them good. And that is
the very reason why I consider it my duty
to divulge to all mankind the fact that it
was only through using Clements Tonic at
the eleventh hour that my awful sufferings
were checked. Through reading a kindly-
disposed person’s testimonial I started tak-
ing it, and ever since those words appeared
before me I have regarded them with as
much respect as though they had consti-
tuted a message from an angel above. When
I come to consider how much agony I en-
dured I am devoutly thankful that the right
remedy came at last.”
“ Was it after eating that you felt so
ill ? ”
“Well, if you like to call it eating.it
was, but my appetite was so very quickly
appeased that I could not take even a
moderate meal. Two or three mouthfuls of
light diet were always enough, and then the
jurist unmerciful pains in the chest started.
my anguish you would have
been moved, as the suffocating sensations in-
duced such desperate efforts to get my
breath that an onlooker would have feared
I was going to choke. A fearful state of
weakness was brought about, and I was
compelled to lie down the greater part of
the day, my household duties, of course,
being out of the question so far as I was
concerned. A dreadful aching pain settled
across my brow, as if its mission was to
destroy all the pleasures in life, and it cer-
tainly succeeded, for I felt cheerless and
careworn beyond expression. This state of
things was bad enough in the day time, but
when I had to go through the same horrors
night, for the want of sleep, my sorrowful
condition can be imagined. Gradually the
desh wasted off my bones, and in the mean-
time my skin changed to a pallid hue, while
the weaker I got the more my limbs ached.
My lips and hands were as white as if my
Mood had turned to water, and when I
•aised my head I became quite giddy. If I
tried to walk u tairs I felt so dazed that I
’ould not go two steps alone, a strange mist
d«o appearing before my eyes, which nearly
lways felt swollen and weak, as if I were
uffering from a severe cold. Acute pains
•truck me between my shoulder-blades, too,
while the aches across my loins were as pain-
ful as they could be. My mouth was never
free from a taste as bitter as gall, and there
was a sticky substance over my tongue !
which I could never wash off, these two ad-
verse elements combined making me con-
tinually feel sick.”
“How did your nervous system bear up
against all this ? ”
“Very well for a time, and then my
nerves gave way quite suddenly. The least
excitement produced a fit of trembling, my
mind also being agitated on the slightest
provocation. But, so far as that goes, my
brain always seemed to be in a restless state,
for if I got an hour or two’s doze, it in-
variably meant that I had some kind of ugly
dream, the recollection of which frightened
me on awaking.”
“You certainly had very little comfort in
life at that time, Mrs. Eagar.”
“There was really nothing left for me to
live for, and the melancholy thoughts with
which I was seized through my heart pal-
pitating very badly made me heartily sick
and tired of everything ; but when I read
about Clements Tonic I thought I might at
least get a little better if I tried it, and I
think my present appearance speaks for it-
self. When my recovery began it was by
acquiring an appetite through the use of
Clements Tonic, and already that medicine
had done me more service than all the other
decoctions put together, because there was
an inward sense of comfort after my food
which told me that digestion was being pro-
perly performed. Ido not wish you to be-
lieve that this wonderful amount of relief
came instantly, because such a thing, con-
sidering the plight I was in, would be im-
possible, but it was certainly the speedy and
direct result of taking Clements Tonic, and,
moreover, I was soon sufficiently eased from
headaches and pains to admit of sound
sleep helping me towards the goal I desired
to reach. The medicine I was taking suited
my complaints splendidly, as the fearful
pains in my chest diminished as each dose
of Clements Tonic was taken, while flatu-
lence and giddiness were remedied quite
mysteriously. Drowsiness and despondency
were wafted away by the medicine, which
was likewise bracing together my shattered
nerves, and its regulating powers had a
beneficial effect which I have enjoyed up to
the present day. My skin soon became
clear and bright, which showed that
Clements Tonic, had a more powerful in-
fluence over my blood than any physic I had
hitherto purchased, and the unpleasant taste
was altogether removed from my mouth. It
did not take a great deal of Clements Tonic
to rid me of those wearying aches which had
come upon me through excessive weakness,
and when they were gone there was nothing
to stop me from doing my housework with
as much activity and cheerfulness as ever.
Indeed, it was a blessing to work and live,
for before my last bottle of Clements Tonic
was finished I was well and sound in every
respect, and not one of my old ailments has
troubled me since. A lesson like mine
should be taught all invalids, so you can
publish these words in any way you
choose.”

THE HERO.
The total loan expenditure during the past six years had been £41,000,000. The loan expenditure of their predecessors, the Carruthers and Wade
Ministries, was £13,000,000, or an average of £2,000,000 a year. If those Governments had spent money at the rate of £4,000,000 a year, the Labor
Government would not have been confronted with the desperate arrears which met them when they took office.— N.S.W. Treasurer Holman's Financial Statement.
HOLMAN (to Police-Constable the Public): “Ish not my fault, conshabl. There wash Arshdeacon Boyce never had a drink all lash week; an’ Jimmy Marion,

A GOOD REPORT
From Camperdown
The Case of
Mr. E. J. SWORDS,
(By a Special Reporter.)
A condition o! affairs favourable to
all sorts of ailments that had been in
existence a good while received an ef-
fective check, in connection with which
a newspaper man paid a visit of en-
quiry to Mr. Edward John Swords’
business premises, 150 Missenden-road,
Campjerdown, and received the follow-
ing reply :—
“Yes, said Mr. Swords, “I can eas-
ily tell you all that is of importance
in connection with the illness 1 escap-
ed from in 1896, when 1 was living at
Trangie, on the great-western line—a
very hot place, too.”
“How long were you residing there?”
“Three years. Quito long enough to
ascertain that it was principally the
heat which was knocking mq out, with
the sedentary nature of my trade,
which is that of a saddler. 1 got to
feel so much out of sorts that 1 could
not stand being indoors!, so 1 had to
leave my work and go travelling. The
chango seemed to give me a lift for a
while, but it was not long before 1 got
into my old state again, and as time
wore on my health went from bad to
worse. When 1 got up of a morning 1
felt fearfully languid, and 1 pictured
each day as it started as a long,
dreary term that would never end, ana
how I would get through it I did not
know. But even when they terminated
I was no better off, as nightfall only
meant so much restlessness that I did
not know what to do to put in the
time till morning, and when it arrived
and I had to get up, I felt so weak
and low-spin loti that I did not care
what happened. My internal disorders
caused such a bitter taste to como to
my mouth that on arising I often felt
inclined to retch, but 1 couldn’t, and 1
was never prepared to sit down and
eat a breakfast like a man should do.
As soon as I sat to the table, and the
food came in sight, a sickly sensation
came to my stomach, and i would
have to get up and leave every thinor
untouched, but, later in the day, l was
generally more sucecs ful in eating a
little —very little, because my appetite
was weak —but it didn’t make any dif-
ference, as my digestion was gone al-
together.''
“What wero your feelings like when
you had eaten ?”
“Dreadful 1 l can her ly describe
them. My chest had src'.i a sensation
in it that I don’t know what to S'ay.
I know 1 felt that if [ turned round
quicKly it would break in two, and ti e
way I sometimes had to gasp for
breath would have made you think I
was astlimatical. Then I also suffered
from cramps in the stomach, caused,
no doubt, by wind that gathered thero
from the decayed food, and if L had to
go through the same again, I would
much rather die. Many a time I ac-
tually sang out with pain, which also
used to find its way down my right
side, and almost cripple me. Heaven
knows, I was a martyr !”
“Did you find your weight reduced
at all ?’’
“1 fell away terribly—front eleven
stone four pounds down to about ton
stone. Just mei'elv a skeleton of what
I had been ; and what made mo feel my
afflictions so great y was hardly being
able to move without feeling incon-
venience. I havo done a good deal of
rough riding in my time, and used to
enjoy it, but when ,T was ilk I,couldn't
get on the quietest animal living with-
out the motion hurting mo. For, be-
sides what I’ve told you, I had such
intense pain across my back that I wa’s
compelled to walk bent up li|e an old
man.” ’
“brow long were you ailing lil o this?”
“For fully twelve months, and you
had better believe that during that
time 1 did not continue suffering for
the want of taking physic—no, indeed.
I took a great many bottles of medi-
cines, only, I’m sorry to say, to find
that my money had gone for nothing,
in some instances, to bo made worse
than 1 was before. There was ono lot
of advertised pills I took which made
mo feel that 1 was going to die, I felt
so ill, and after them, thank heaven !, I
procured some Clements Tonic. Ah !
how I soon wished I had taken that
remedy before. What a year of tor-
ture it would have saved me, but it is
no use regretting. I’m lucky to havo
Sot off lino I did, and tnero is no
oubt that Clements Tonic is entitled
to all the credit, for that was the only
remedy that could do me any good.
Why, if you could form an idea of the
intensity of the headaches from which
I regularly suffered you would say that
nothing but a miracle could have
cured them, and if that’s so then Cle-
ments Tonic must bo a miraculous me-
dicine, for it cured mine. Besides this
it also put an end to the giddy turns
I used to have. Upon my word, at one
time I could not stoop down without
feeling as if I would surely fall over,
and I have often been sitting on a
chair and expecting to come a cropper
every second owing to the same dis-
agreeable sensation. My sight had
been very dim for a good while, my
eyes feeling swollen, and as if they had
a scum over them ; my tongue used to
be white with fur, too, yet Clements
tTonic sot all these defects to rights,
Wen when all other things had oeen
put aside as useless.”
""You mentioned that you had done
some rough-riding in your time. You
require good nerves for that sort of
business; don’t you ?”
""I should rather say so ; but I had
been without them for quite twelve
months previous to using Clements
Tonic, and Would never have had good
nerves again but for that remedy. I
had hot only been so nervous that I
1 could not keep myself from shaking,
but even my mind was easily upset by
any ncists, which made mo exceeding-
ly irritable,'and I was always fearing
somo kind of evil. The greater part of
my nigbts vvoro spent in restlessness,
for l was always thinking, thinking,
and when at last I dozed into slum-
ber. the dreams I had wero awful—for
all the world lif e the nightmaio. Web, it
was a happy day for me when I de-
cided td buy Clements Tonic, as it put
quite a different complexion upon the
whole of my career. It imparted more
strength to my nerves than they ever
had before, and there’s nothing in the
world Mko that remedy to make ore
sleep arid cat. Tn a few weeks I
couldn’t locate a pain of any soi fc
about my body, and the best of it was
that I was gaining strength and
weight all the time.”
""Did Clements Tonic euro you tho-
roughly ?”
""My ,curo couldn’t have been moro
eomp'etc, and I trust my experience
may bet an object lesson to all who
require treatment. In any case you
may publish this narrative in any form
you desire.”

“THE BULLETIN” OFFERS THE ACCOMPANYING SUGGESTION FOR NEXT YEAR’S N.S.W. MILITARY CAMP.
"" A member of one of the volunteer regiments,
who has left the samp, called at the Sunday Times
Office yesterday to complain ‘of the execrable man-
ner in which the provisions had been provided to
the men.’ In each tent, he said, there are nine men,
and on Friday the steak supplied would not have
been sufficient for two ; while only two
pots of potatoes of about 201 b. each were
provided for 250 men. The water supply was
also unsatisfactory, and the potatoes which
tbe men received were, in consequence, but half-
cooked. Upon such food the men were expected to
go out on a four or five hours’ march. The third
and fourth sections of the Scottish Rifles, he de-
clared, refused for some time to move, but were
finally persuaded on the promise of something more
substantial on their return, with the exception of
three or four, and they were instantly dismissed. The
men, the complainant also added, not being able to get
anything to eat or drink, sought relief at the bar,
and some imbibed rather freely. About 50 of the
Irish Rifles, dissatisfied with their treatment, left
the camp in a body, and out of- the remainder enough
men to form a guard were unobtainable. In conclu-
sion, he added that in his opinion it was ‘ the biggest
blow the volunteer movement has had.’ ”

Some brilliant genius sug-
gests that the police go up in
a balloon and search for the
Breelong blacks with a spy-glass.
Another equally brilliant suggestion is that the N.S.W.
Govt. Analyst be instructed to hocus a lot of whisky to be
left promiscuously about the bush for the Governors
to get hold of and thus facilitate their capture.
Whoever suggested this last is no friend of the police.
“At any rate, Sullivan,”
says Sergeant Dooley, “ they
can’t lave no insoolting mes-
sages fur us oop here.”
No doubt a policeman’s boot dropped
from a balloon at a high altitude upon a
Breelong black’s head would
make him sit up.

A LIVERS VAGARIES.
Nervous Weakness and Exhaustion.
A Great Change for the Better,
The Case of
Mrs E. SHEWANi
(BV OCR REPORTER )
Mrs. Elizabeth Shewan. of No. 8 Little
Ed ward-street, Pyrmont, was recently in-
terviewed by & press representative, and
gave her views on various matters of in-
terest.
“I am given to understand that you
created a great surprise amongst your
neighbours a little while back,” said the
newspaper man. “ Will you kindly tell me
what it was all about ? ”
“ With the utmost pleasure,” was the
hearty reply. “It was by shaking off a
long-standing comp aiut that I surprised
everybody, myself included, for I had been
suffering for many years from dyspepsia.
The reason why my recovery was unex-
pected was because I had been under the
care of several doctors, taking their medi-
cines till I positively loathed the sight of it,
besides being treated as an out-door patient
at a hospital for five months, and no good
came from all the physics which had been
administered to me. What else could I
think than that I was incurable ? And to
be in such a hopeless predicament was really'
awful. Eartli and heaven were both blotted
out of my existence, as the inetficacy of the
medical treatment I had received left me
alone in the world with nothing but physi-
cal suffering to endure. For years there
was scarcely a day passed but that 1 felt
intensely tired and so weary and weak that
I had to let my work go undone because I
was unable to do it, and often I could hardly
get about for the terrible pains in my chest
and between my shoulders. It seemed as if
something heavy was preventing me from
getting my breath, and if the weather was
at all warm the smothering sensations were
frightfully distressing. The whole of my
system was out of order, the consequence
being that I was hardly ever without a de-
pressing headache, and a feeling as if my
eyes were swollen also troubled me. When-
ever I made an effort to do a little work the
exertion made me feel lightheaded, and at
times I was afraid to go outside the door on
account of giddiness, which used to seize me
and make me powerless to stand on my feet.
Another reason why I deemed it prudent to
keep as still as possible was that any exer-
tion gave me palpitation of the heart. It
might be through getting up from a chair
rather too quickly, or, perhaps, through a
little agitation caused by sounds in the
street that the palpitations came on ; but in
every instance I felt greatly distressed, to
say nothing of the fears about what might
be wrong with me which entered my mind.
So many people in this country die from
various affections of the heart that anything
wrong with that organ is naturally alarm-
ing, but I now know that it was my liver
which causes those serious symptoms to
appear.”
“ Were there any other liver symptoms in
evidence ? ”
“ Well, the gall-like taste in my mouth
and the furred condition of my tongue
pointed to the fact that my internal organs
required renovating, whi'e to digest my food
was an utter impossibility. Try what I
would in the form of light diet, it was all
the same, after eating being violent spasms
of wind in the stomach which almost drove
me frantic, ahd often I felt incined to roll
on the floor in the excess of agony, which
was making my life insupportable- r, 'he
food I had eaten was not taken from cuoice,
because I had no appetite for it, aud it was
this continuous loss of appetite which
grieved me, as 1 knew that I could never get
strong so long as I was unable to take
nourishment to give me strength. And as
my vitality wasted away, so did my loins
and limbs ache. I felt as sore as if I had
been beaten from head to foot, and no won-
der that my bones were racked with aches,
for my body and brain seldom got any rest.
Sleepless nights I passed in profusion, al-
though if I slept at all I dreamed in such a
terrifying manner, that wakefulness would
have been far preferable. What a nervous
wreck I I ecame, to be sure ! My nerves
were so weak and highly strung that if any-
body knocked at the door I nearly jumped
out of my chair, and then it took them a
long time to get steady again. A dread of
something happening tormented my mind
both day and night, but did I not have good
reason to be like that, considering that my
disease stood defiantly against my medi-
cines ? ”
As you are so well now, Mrs. Shewan,
that statement is scarcely correct.”
“I mean up to the time of taking
Clements Tonic ; then everything changed
for the better. * I made a great mistake in
not heeding the advi e of many of my friends
who had repeatedly urged me to take
Clements Tonic ; but I thought if doctors
could not cure me, nothing could. When at
last I became persuaded, Clements Tonic
soon showed what a mistaken notion this
was, for after taking two or three bottles I
felt quite different, my improved appearance
being the subject of general comment
amongst my neighbours. The appetite I
gained through the medium of Clements
Tonic was, to say the least of it, remark-
able. I was always ready for my meals,
and how could I enjoy them ? That dull
and heavy feeling after eating passed away,
and when my food ceased turning to wind
and creating pain, I could soon go about in
comfort ana do a little work, for I always
woke up feeling fresh and vigorous after the
sound sleep which came thiough using
Clements Tonic. In time my chest and
head pains disappeared, and nothing gave
me greater satisfaction than the banishment
of my heart troubles. I could walk about
quite briskly without there being any pal-
pitation or dizziness, the only inconvenience
which I expei ienced after three weeks’ use
of Clements Tonic being from nervousness,
for I still trembled a little if I had been ex-
erting myself very much ; but in a few days
later that trouble was entirely remedied,
and it has never come bark again. My
digesdve system was thoroughly restored to
order, and from that day to this I must say
that the weary aches in my limbs have been
strangers. The acute pains in my head and
shoulders were also carried away by
Clements Tonic, which regulated my in-
ternal organs to a nicety. Such a catalogue
of human suffering as mine was could not
have been more severe, yet Clements Tonic
relieved me of every pain, besides pouring
into my system the invigorating and disease-
curing qualities it possessed, so that I was
left with the full vigour and health of my
younger days. The return of that alacrity
and cheerfulness of spirits that I was wont
to have made my recovery complete, and I
am not likely to forget that it is to Clements
Tonic that my gratitude is owing.”
“ \\ ill you make that admission through
the press ? ”
“ Willingly, for I recognise the fact that
many people are suffering in despair like I
was, and for their benefit you may publish
my testimony in any way you choose.”

"" A member of one of the volunteer regiments,
who has left the samp, called at the Sunday Times
Office yesterday to complain ‘of the execrable man-
ner in which the provisions had been provided to
the men.’ In each tent, he said, there are nine men,
and on Friday the steak supplied would not have
been sufficient for two ; while only two
pots of potatoes of about 201 b. each were
provided for 250 men. The water supply was
also unsatisfactory, and the potatoes which
tbe men received were, in consequence, but half-
cooked. Upon such food the men were expected to
go out on a four or five hours’ march. The third
and fourth sections of the Scottish Rifles, he de-
clared, refused for some time to move, but were
finally persuaded on the promise of something more
substantial on their return, with the exception of
three or four, and they were instantly dismissed. The
men, the complainant also added, not being able to get
anything to eat or drink, sought relief at the bar,
and some imbibed rather freely. About 50 of the
Irish Rifles, dissatisfied with their treatment, left
the camp in a body, and out of- the remainder enough
men to form a guard were unobtainable. In conclu-
sion, he added that in his opinion it was ‘ the biggest
blow the volunteer movement has had.’ ”

HOLIDAYS FOR THE POLICE,
in view of a certain order that has just been,
posted up at the various police stations, in pur-
suance of instructions issued by Mr. Fosbery,
Inspector-General of Police, the fears of the
police on the subject of holidays, which were
referred to in Sati>*icy's Issue, seem to have beea
well founded. *lt was thought Jthat, chiefly
owing to the instrumentality of Mr. Dacey, M.P.,
the police we«b to be given 14 days' leave each
year, qui'e independent of the day a month which,
they have been In the habit of receiving for
.years past, but the whole thing seems to be a
are and a delusion, despite the Premier s asser-
tion that he would place the police of New South
Wales on a footing as good as that of any other
country, ?o far as holidays were concerned. The
.order referred to at once dispels any idea that
might have existed in the minds of the over-
sanguine representatives of law and order, for it
makes it quite' clear that no policeman will get
more than 14 days’ leave during the year. This
leave, it Is Intimated, may be had all at once,
or it may be divided, or (if preferred) one day in
month may be had, together with an extra
qouple of days to make up the fourteen. All
of which makes somebody or other wondrous
[kind. The gigantic concession that the police
are to have in the way of leave is two days per
annum.

I’ltICE Su.
PROLOGUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Enter, before the curtain, WAR, an old, bald, bespectacled man, in his gorgeous uniform of Generalissimo. He speaks the Prologue.
Ladies and gentlemen, the players wait.
But ere I ring the impatient curtain up
Upon this drama, I would have you know
What spectacle I have for you prepared,
What play it is that, after many years
Of preparations and postponements, I
Have for your craved approval proudly built.
You may have viewed some pretty plays of
war, '
Wherein a nice young officer arrayed
In scarlet or in khaki swaggered through
Some well stage-managed battles, for his
King. „
(There was no blood to spoil the pretty
The dead that fell fell cleanly, neatly killed ,
And if the hero had to nurse a wound
He lost an arm, whereo’er his sweetheait
grieved. ~
He was not shot in places unromantic ,
His entrails did not clutter up the scene ,
He did not lose his nose.) But this, my
great curtain now divides from
Is War!’War unadorned, the naked thing.
There are no medals and no epaulettes
In my poor drama. Stolid business-men
My generals are, who play a placid game
Di dominoes with little army-coips,
And t Jg s Wlth mUrdered men for their mls ‘
My drama has no decorative scene;
For all is smoke and flame and mud and
noise
And squirming things that once
Dismembered, crunched or shattered, still
alive
Or fortunately dead. No bugle shrills
Its clarion call. No colors blaze in pride
Before these grimy regiments. No charge
Of gallant horses nobly sweeps the field.
But here and there a soldier lies and snipes
A fellow-soldier somewhere out of sight;
Or screaming shrapnel brings untidy death ;
Or from the sky there floods a clotted red
Where grim mechanics grapple fatuously
In brittle little chariots of air.
There are a thousand scenes within my play,
It ranges o’er a mighty continent,
Perchance oer all the globe. It shows each
race
I n blmd and sullen anger flinging death —
Strange, poisoned, sudden, scientific death—
To fellow-men across its frontier line.
It shows a continent all desolate,
So sown lvith barren bullets that no green
Will ever grow again. It shows vast towns
In the grim clutch of hunger-driven mobs ;
It shows sweet villages all smelling rank
With putrefying corpses; and it shows
Dead women and dead children and dead
babes.
The actors in my drama are but men,
Mere men and women, rather like your-
selves,
And starving children like the little ones
Each night in cosy cots you hush to sleep.
The soldiers are but men in uniform —
The ordinary men you see in trams
Or work with in your office. They are all
Just husbands, brothers, fathers, lovers,
armed
With rifles, not umbrellas, curtly told
To kill some other rather decent chaps
Because they live across a little line
Made arbitrarily upon a map.
But though a continent I have for stage
I cannot picture war; for far beyond
Each battlefield another hidden fight
Goes on relentlessly. For every man
That you see smashed by shells, by cholera
killed,
Disembowelled, lopped or dying of gangrene,
Picture a little house, a pleasant home
With wife and children waiting anxiously,
Not knowing—maybe, ne’er indeed to know —
If they are widowed, orphaned. Picture
this
For every one of all these patient men
Hidden in trenches, spattered grey with oil
In aeroplanes, or deep in submarines
Beneath the sanguined sea.
Nay, picture more!
The curtain that I wait the word to draw
Will show you not a drama but yourselves.
This kindly curtain long has held you safe
From all the horrors of my spectacle.
It is a fragile frontier line between
You and the grim realities of war.
And when I ring the curtain up, beware!
The action on the stage will spread to you :
My shells wilt strike and rend the occupants
Of gallery and stalls and circle. You,
The actors and the victims of my play!
You are the soldiers and the soldiers’ wives,
The little children waiting for their dad;
You are the dying, the dismembered dead;

' English ttepers to up

Generally speaking, the idea of a war be-

dered, in Europe at least, and in the most
influential circles in the States, as one erf
the most improbable events of history.

With reference to Mr. Thomas Alva Ed!i-1
I son’s inventions, the inventor has (so Dal-
ziel says) made the following remarkable
i statement:— |
I “It would require but the impetus of war
to develop such a flood of destructive appli-
ances as would astonish the world. There
is no need of a battle between two large |
armies in the field. A mere handiful of
men could sweep one of them away. The
power to do this is electricity. Water can
be made more deadly than bullets. I have
invented a machine by which it cam be
hurled to a great distance, and water
charged with 5000 volts and then dashed on
an army would sweep it away like chaff.

TO THE EDITOR.
Sir,—l notiee in your issue ol to-day that
the War Office in England suggests the for-
mation of volunteer reserves in the colonies.
The idea is a good one, and my object in
writing is for the purpose of giving prac-
tical effect to the suggestion.
| I venture to invite the volunteers, who,
I from 1854 to the present time have passed
i through the ranks, to call here and sign
I a requisition to the Mayor of Sydney, to
j convene a meeting at an early date of all
i ex-volunteers to organise and enroll a force
| of patriotic men; to form what is known in
Germany as the Landwehr, and thus show
the enemies cf England that we are willing
to, aid the old country by strengthening her
outside dependencies,
! Personally, as an old volunteer officer
and one of the earliest to enlist during the
/time of the Russian war of 1854-6, I still
feel able to shoulder a musket, and I think
on emergency >could bring do’wn my man.
'X am willing to; join the rank and file of the
proposed reserve for defence purposes.—
‘ GEORGE R. DIBBS-

A BALLAD OF REVOLUTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE King sat in Dumbfearful town,
Drinking the blood-red wine;
His brow was twisted to a frown,
His whiskers drooped like twine.
Without, the Revolution roared;
And orators in rows
Their, eager congregations bored
With loud, fantastic prose.
So well they talked, so long they spoke,
Their throats grew rough and sore;
And perspiration madly broke
From every glistening pore.
The veins upon their foreheads swelled;
Their hard-stretched collars burst;
No power could stay the words they
yelled
Till language died in thirst.
The Red Guards howled their fierce
applause
Each time a speaker failed;
Terrific curses filled each pause
And long the women wailed;
The warships fired a loud salute,
The sun went redly down;
And everybody cried for loot
In grey Dumbfearful town.
Oh, blood is redder far than wine,
And flame is far more hot!
(The Royal whiskers sagged like twine
Above the boozing pot.)
And loud without the clamor w 7 ent,
And shriller grew the din;
The discord of the firmament
Ra..g like cow-trodden tin.
And fiercely rolled the flood of speech
Like fifty streams in flood,
With i«fty lessons they must teach
To one low r bank of mud.
The red flags waved, the trumpets blew;
Word-scourged the people rose
Tremendous things to dare and do
Against their age-long foes.
They pulled the palace railings down,
They smashed the palace door,
They broke the throne and kicked the
crown
About the wash-house floor;
But greater, darker deeds than these
The Revolution knew.
(Oh, flags upon the battle-breeze!
The Guards were lame and few!)
Uprising, roaring like the tide,
They hurst each bond and bar.
The royal cat to music died
Wearing a cross and star.
Stern men they were, and unafraid
Of aught that life might bring—
They got a safety-razor blade
And smoothly shaved the King!
N.S.W.
CURSE O' MOSES.

HORATIUS HANLON AT THE BRIDGE.
Mick Healyus (McCracken erst),
By his Red gods he lied:
“The bridge I’ll force, though a bleeding corse.”
“Come, friends!” Horatius cried.
Then out spake Spurius Chifleyus,
Who bleats from sea to sea:
“I will NOT stand at thy right hand
And keep the bridge with thee!”
And quoth McGirrnominius,
Pale at the gills was he:
“What, risk my nob in a Commo mob?
Not me, Ned H., not me!”
With drinking and with laughter
They still the story tell,
How Horatius Hanlon kept the bridge
When others ran like hell.

THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE POLICE
FORCE.
Mr. Norton moved ""That, in the opinion of
this House, a Royal Commission, consisting of not
less than five persons, one of whom shall be a Supreme
Court Judge and one a member of the Legislative
Assembly, should be appointed to inquire into and
report upon the present condition, organisation, and
administration of the police force of New South
Wales.” It was, he said, a notorious fact that the
administration of the police force in Sydney was im-
perfect. He could prove that after Warrants had been
issued for the arrest of notorious criminals they had
been allowed to escape. He would prove all his
atateinents. Therefore he asked the Government to
agree to his motion
The Colonial Secretary said he would not agree
to it. There had not been a single case of maladminis-
tration or misconduct on the part of the police brought
• under hi 3 notice by the hon. member who asked for
the commission, and he (Mr. See) was head of the
department. Out of something like 3000 police there
must- cf necessity be some who were not altogether
perfect in the discharge of their duties ; but that was
not a sufficient-reason for the appointment of a Royal
Commission to inquire into the whole question of
police administration throughout the country.
L.B.M. (to returned, Lancer) : “ So you didn’t join the great Boer hunt 1 ”
I.angek : “ No, I went to England to cut lemons, not to shoot Boers ; so I have come back.’
L.B.M. : “ On the principle that ‘ He who cuts and conies away, may live to cut another dav ’
And quite right, too ! ” ' y ’
A SLIGH T VARIATION.
Norton: “ I’ve arrested him, your Wor-
ship, for being fonnd in possession of a
large terrace of houses reasonably supposed
to have been stolen.”

A PREMIER’S PROGRESS.
""Ministers have been banqueting and speech-making, and receiving deputations, from the Queen laml lnorlor to Broken-hill, and people every part of
the country have had opportunities of personally impressing their local necessities on members of the Govermment, It is not to be wondered at that these chances
have been eagerly taken. And the residents would neglect their opportunities-in addition to depriving the Ministerial tour of its raison d’etre- if they did not bring
their axes to the grindstone so providentially sent.”— REID ORGAN.

The PressjCen and tub Newsbots.— Preaching
at the Pil.t-street Congregational Church last
night, the Rev. E. -T. Duustan said he felt he
should be neglecting his duty if he did not make
a protest against the'action of certain represen-
tatives of the press last Sunday. Had he listened
to the dictates of expediency, or obeyed the voice of
inclination, he would have remained silent, but for
the second time certain ""pressmen had outraged
the sentiment of the community by organising a
picnio for newsboys cn the Lord’s Day. The law
stood upon the Statute Books, and should, there-
fore, be obasrved. The pre&s exercised a power-
ful, moral, social, and political influence, and the
community had a right to look to it for carefu 1
guidance.

Yesterday bad been proclaimed by the Govern-
ment as a day of humiliation and prayer for rain,
but happily it was converted into a day of fhanks-
piving instead.
I Archbishop Smith had pi omulgated a form of prayer
' which was in consonance with the proclamation.
By the prayer it was contemplated that worsbip-
l pers should hntnble themselves before God
in this tboir “ time of special distress and
anxiety.” This really related to the condition of
things prior to the general fall of rain, and as it
I was considered that it did not correctly describe the
j condition of affairs now prevailing, some clergy-
men manifested a reluctance to use the form, and
relied upon the special prayer and thanksgiving
embraced in the ‘‘Book of Common Prayer.”
Some ministers used the special form of prayer ,
for rain issued by the Archbishop, others used
the ordinary form, and others again used
the thanksgiving. There were yet other I
ministers who, in acknowledgment of the
general rain, read the thanksgiving, and who,
having regard to the wants of those districts still in
need of rain, recited the ordinary prayer for rain.

THE RUSH TO YASSBERRA.
In connection with the controversy over retaining’ Government House in Sydney, King O’Malley (Minister for Home Affairs) suggests that the G.-G. should campon the Federal
capital aite at Yassberra. “There would be beautiful fishing for him,” says the Minister. “ Moreover, he could drink of the waters of the Cotter the purest stream in the world.
There is no water like it. And he could have splendid shooting, too. No better in the world. He would have plenty of room for his horse. Also, he could so familiarise himself
with the territory that when he returned to England he would be able to expound to prospective Governors-General what a beautiful place it is, and what would be the prospects before
them when they got to Australia. I firmly believe that there would be a tremendous rush of applications for the position of King s representative in the Commonwealth. 1 his news
of the attractions of Yass-Canberra and the prospects of spending half the year now and as much of the year as they desire later at the Federal capital would spread through the
Empire. It would be magnificent.”

To the Editor of the Evenino News.
Sir, —As Dr. Thompson, chief of the Health
Department, has announced the disease of the
bubonic germs in rats, one thing is now certain,
that dogs and cats will become the chief vehicles
of transmission to man, not only because of their
disposition to hunt and kill rats, but also because
many of them feed on the dead rats, and because
dogB and cats are often found sniffing round rat-
holes and among straw where rats have been.
All fondling of dogs and cats should for the pre-
sent cease. Certainly, all children found nursing
and kissing cats and dogs should be reproved.
Very great cleanliness must now become the order
of the day. If the authorities established public
dog-baths, this would be much more beneficial
than chasing rats.

GOING BACK TO WORK; THE TOILER WHOSE CASE NO ONE CONSIDERS.
When the coal mines stopped working the horses were brought to the surface. Some of them then saw daylight for the first time in three years.
Many of these veterans went blind after a few days’ sunlight, and groped around miserably, breaking their legs in gullies, where they were some-
times found and mercifully shot, and sometimes left to die of thirst. Three of the parties interested in the coal strike—the miners, the mine-
owners and the consumers—have received a lot of notice. How about the fourth party ?

The LADY or The Tiger
With a Pologiesto
Mr. Frank R. Srockron.
A SOCIAL QUESTION.
Thera are carriages set
apart for ‘ ladies only,’ but
the other sex have to chance
their company. And that
this is no small risk has just
been proved by the incident
reported from. Tasmania,
where a lone man with a
pulmonary complaint found
himself the only fellow-
traveller of an hysterical girl.
As he was taking a dose of
cough-mixture her disordered
imagination smelt what she
thought was chloroform, and,
believing that ho meant to
drug her, she jumped out of
the train at the risk of her
life and laid a serious charge
•gainst him.”— Daily Paper.

“THE IMAGE VILE OF FRAUD.”
Lo, the tell monster with the deadly sting,
Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls
And firm embattled spears, and with his filth
Taints all the world!...
Forthwith that image vile of Fraud appear'd,
His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
The rest was serpent a 11....
As ofttimes a light skiff, moor'd to the shore,
Stands part in water, part upon the land.
Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor.
The beaver settles, watching for his prey,
So on the rim that fenced the sand with rock
Sat perch'd the fiend of evil.

CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
-—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
tlk : e of delicate constitutions.
Tales of the Riverine.
“Dictionary Nod.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRIUE WARUNG.
Emerson says soiu.e where that it is an
achievement of high eloquence to confer an ex-
pressive nick-name, but no particularly fine
ouality, oratorical or other, was needed to attach
n bye-name to Ned .
Ah— now I’m stuck ! It has never dawned
upon me till this moment that in all the years
t liat I knew Ned to bo spoken of, I never heard
his surname once. Perhaps none of the men who
referred to him constantly as one of the biggest
“cures” in that region of “cures” and “queer
cards,” the Riverine district —where each square
mile has its tale of some human soul going to
wreck in its sea of grey plain—knew his surname.
Perhaps he hadn’t one to know. Most likely,
indeed, was this the case. His earliest recollection
went back to the time when he was tending
Parson Marsden’s black poleys on the venerable
Principal Chaplain’s grant at Bathurst, so, as
likely as not, Ned was one of the hundreds of
infants that were cradled in Parramatta Factory
and sent into the world worse than motherless and
with a choice among 50 fathers. At all events, I
am pretty sure none of the fellows who spoke of
y ß d to me knew his surname. Else it must
have slipped out sometimes. But it was always
‘•Dictionary Ned.”
Xow I was saying that anybody without the
faintest touch of eloquence could have given Ned
tliat name—would iiave conferred no other upon
il,im had the selection of a hundred appellations
been offered. Even a Victorian shire-councillor,
who is the least oratorical person in existence,
except when he wants a railway to his front gate,
would have called him “ Dictionary Ned.” The
cjngruity of the term was so obvious that a blind
man could have seen it.
The name had its origin in the fact that Ned
always carried a dictionary-a wonderful sort of
one. It was based “ upon the labours of Johnson,
Worcester, Webster,” and Heaven knows how
many more, “ and incorporated the latest results
uf the most modern and scientific Lexico-
graphers.” Further, it was illustrated by “ one
thousand Superb Engravings from drawings by the
Best Artists’ (I am quoting from the title page)
—and as though that was not enough to furnish
to the humble student, it supplied, at the fore-
part, an “Analytical History of the Growth
of the English Language (in two pages), and, in
appendices, a ‘Glossary’ of Scientific Terms, a
Classical Encyclopedia, and a Collection of Pro-
verbial Sayings and Phrases from all Languages.”
The whole of this overflowing repository of learn-
ing had been published at sixpence; and Ned
paid ninepence for it on his solitary trip to
Melbourne at Cole’s bookstall in Paddy's Market,
in Bourke-street, 25 years ago. Cole wasn’t a
millionaire then, and you couldn’t buy books at
English prices. You paid ninepence for a sixpenny
publication, and fifteen-pence for a shilling one,
andhalf-a-crown, and sometimes three shillings, for
a two-shilling volume. And Ned, paying nine-
pence, had therewith purchased a treasure of
wealth untellable, of joys limitless. All the
glorious orbs in the firmament of culture swam
into his ken when he pocketed the book.
Keats never extracted from Chapman’s Homer,
Landor from Shakespeare, Lindsey Gordon from
Horace, Marcus Clarke from Balzac, one thou-
sandth part of the delight Ned obtained from his
dictionary. The only volume ho ever possessed, to
him it was a library, a literature, mauy-volumed
life itself. Somehow or other, the intangible
charm that the mere study of words as words, as
the fossils of human experience and emotion, has
for so many people, had entranced this illiterate
wanderer whose home was always on the fringe
of “settled country,” who was never at ease
except he was “ inside,” who got astray in a one
street township and was utterly lost in the soli-
tudes of a great city. Amongst the thousand
and one types of humanity that wandered
over the Old Man and One Tree Plains, there was
the man who never turned in till ho had read a
chapter out of his Bible, there was the man who
carried a shilling Shakespeare, and the other who
kept his mind alive on Byron, there was the fellow
who always kept a woman’s photograph, and the
one who nourished his soul amid deadening wastes
by the crucifix dangling round his neck. The
consolation that each and all derived from his and
their several idols, Ned drank in from his pocket-
dictionary.
lie had bought it with the vain hope of
making up the deficiencies of his early educa-
tion. “Never too late to larn, boys,” he would
assure the scoffers. And though he was wise in
the wondrous lore of the plains and the rive s, “up
to any dodge ” in free-selection and station-life,
knew every trick of bush-craft and of river-craft,
had overlanded cattle in the early gold days from
Adelaide to Forest Creek, and (earlier still) sheep
from Bathurst to the valley of the Wannon in far
western “ Port Phillip,” and had held the wheel
of the Lady Augusta when she ran up to Tocum-
wal months before Cadell made his first chart of
the Murray, he esteemed his precious knowledge,
out of which so many “smarter” men had coined
small fortunes, to be worthless compared with
“book-laming.” At every interval of leisure,
and during the times of work when the duty of
the moment would not be impeded by “study,”
out would come his book. When other men
smoked or swopped yarns, or drank, Ned studied.
There was nothing complex about his methods.
1 le went straight at the business of mastering its
contents.
Somewhere about forty years of age when he
invested his ninepence, by the time he became
bargeman of the Royal Duke barge—she was built
in the epoch when ferocious “loyalty” dislocated
a man’s neck as consort of the Currency La>s
steamer, he was within a year or two of fifty. And
unremitting in his pursuit of knowledge with all
sorts of difficulties, he had mastered the dictionary
so far as “ V,” the page that begins with “ vital ”
and ends with “ votive.” Ten words a day for a
minimum, and a hundred for a maximum—when
he had a rare holiday he totted up the hundred —
he had got off by rote the words and their mean-
ings. And this was without counting the
Sundays. He had devoted those to the “ Glossary”
and the, “ Proverbial Sayings and Phrases,’ and
to the horrible combination of letters which Ih >
dictionary-compiler, on the authority of the
modern and scientific lexicographer, used to
express the pronunciation of the foreign phrases.
It was a gigantic task this last, and Ned had done
well to devote his Sabbaths to it when he had no
other occupation than to boil his white shirt for
the next Sunday. Mezzofanti himself would have
felt the task of memorising the phrases to be
herculean if lie had also found it necessary to
recjlh-et the kev to their pronunciation. .lust
think of the labour of getting off by heart not
merely the interpretation, for instance, of
L’homme propose el Dieu dispose, but the weird
and mysterious conjunction of letters which the
latest modern and scientific lexicographer
expressed the sound of the phrase: “lom-pro-a-
dyoo-dis-poz.” But all these fearful and wonder-
ful shibboleths were gradually being mastered by
Ned—to an accent, lie was a beggar to learn,
was Ned. As he himself said, “he warn’t no
slouch at stickin’ to it.”
That was the curious thing about Ned. All Ins
grinding away at vocabularies never seemed to
tinge by the faintest degree of refined colour his
vigorous colloqualism. Perhaps, in some distaiit
period, when he contemplated sitting under his
own vine and fig-tree —the most errant knight of
the Murrumbidgee plains has always a vision of
some roof-tree o’ his ain—he intended to employ
his “dictionary words,” but in the days of his
scholarship he kept to the rude, energetic speech
of his kind.
Nor was it clear why he hadn’t begun “laming”
before he reached middle-age. Once he was
interrogated upon the point, but the answer,
though apparently at the moment conclusive, does
not appear a sufficient explanation now that we
can look back.
11.
It was in the following circumstances that the
question was put to him, and the answer re-
ceived. Ned was running shares in a fencing
contract on Benduck at the ’Bidgee. Sunday
came, and Ned, having washed and ironed the
white shirt he had worn at intervals during the
week in readiness for the succeeding Sunday,
donned his other “ b’iled rag ” and the moleskins
which lie called his “ go-to-meetln’s,” though they
never went there. His toilette operations weie
observed with keen interest by one of the fellows
who had sundowned it to the men’s hut the
previous night in the expectation of the plum-duff
and lot of rum which Benduck, even more liberal
than other stations, invariably gave to the Satur-
day to Monday “whalers.” A man of middle
height and naturally sturdy frame, already, while
still young, he carried himself with the swagman’s
stoop, and his watery eyes gave the lie to the story
of natural or acquired refinement which the clear-
cut features would have otherwise told. Dirty
with the indescribable dirt of the man of position
who is debased to a congenial gutter, College Bill
revolted, as he lay on a sheepskin in the early sun-
shine, against Ned’s sacrifice at the altar of clean-
“ Who’s that toff ? ” he asked of the cook.
“bin? W’y, that’s Dic-shun-cry Ned ! Never
’erd of ’im ? ”
“ That Dictionary Ned ! My word, I didn't
know he went in for white shirts and collars ! I’ll
have some fun with him, boys—just you come and
watch ! ” .
Now, College Bill was esteemed a bit of a
humourist, or rather of a satirist. For a “Bishop
Barker” he would compose a quatrain on any
subject—a person preferred—suggested by the man
who tipped him the drink, ana for a bottle of
brandy he would write a fifty-line satire and recite
it with becoming action. It was whispered among
the bosses and “colonial-experiencers ” that he
was a University prize poem man, but that could
hardly be so, for Bill’s “Ode to Swipes,” the
shanty-keeper at One Tree, was quoted all over the
Riverine for its originality and force, and since
the first University was, there has never been a
prize-poem which contained these qualities.
Being what he was. Bill always had a claque,
and when he meandered his odorous carcase to the
tank side, where Ned was performing his toilette,
lie was followed by several others of the sundown-
ing brotherhood prepared in advance to applaud
his satirical efforts at old Dictionary’s expense.
They were already in laughter by the time they
had covered half the distance between the hut and
the tank, for Bill, as ho walked, improvised—
Devoted student! while other “ whalers” slumber
He studies hard, does Dictionary Ned !
But still he’s storing only useless lumber
In the squash pumpkin which he calls his head 1
“You’re Dictionary Ned, arn’t you?” began
Bill, as he approached. “I’m Bill College
Bill, the boys call me. Shake !”
Ned turned at the remark. Perhaps it was the
circumstance that his fingers were busy buttoning
his collar—he had only the one collar—that pre-
vented him accepting Bill’s preferred hand. Any-
how, he did not take it. He simply nodded and
said :
“Oh, yer Bill, are yer ?—College Bill? I’ve
hern o’ yer 1”
“Yes,” responded Bill, not feeling quite so easy
as he should, his reception was so chilling, “ no
doubt you have. Being brother students, y’
know ” —he paused to wink impressively at his
admirers —“ we ought to be acquainted 1”
“Ye-es —yer think so?” drawled Ned.
‘ ‘ Of course. Men of culture are not too numerous
on the river country.”
“So?”
There was a titter, not quite at Ned’s expense.
Bill was annoyed at it, and grew truculent.
“ Do you know 1 think you should drop the
‘ Ned,’ my friend.”
“Yes?”
“ You should style yourself ‘Dick.’ ‘Dictionary
Dick ’ would be not only alliterative, but would
be more euphonious !” The chorus of laughter
again went up—now on Bill’s side. Wasn’t Bill
rubbing it in ! What jaw-breakers lie could use !
Ned didn't reply, but withdrew his dictionary
from the hip-pocket where he always carried it.
“ Going to look up ‘ alliterative ’ and
‘euphonious,’ old chap?” Bill continued. “Now
don’t turn up ‘ H —you’ll find the first under ‘A,’
and ‘euphonious’ under ‘E.’” And the rouse-
abouts and swagmen grew merrier. Bill was
getting on well with his chiacking of old Ned !
Ned, however, was still silent.
“Ned,” went on Bill, “ the only two men I ever
heard of that were books in breeches were
Macaulay and yourself. Macaulay was a beggar
to talk, but you’re a beggar to keep your mouth
shut. Oh, and by-the-way, why didn’t you take
your schooling earlier ?”
“ I don’t usu’lly ring my clapper on’y when I’ve
got some toon to play,” now responded Ned.
“ That answers yer first remark. An’, as ter the
second, it’s my turn ter ask questions. Yer can
read French, Mister Bill Boozer—l beg parding—
I mean. Mister College Bill ?”
Over his drunkard’s rosiness, Bill’s face showed
a deeper red. And the audience rejoiced exceed-
ingly. “Who’d ’a thought as ol’ Dicshunery
war goin’ ter take down College Bill ?”
“Can you read French, Mister? I’ve hear say
that yer ses as yer could. An’ if yer can, jest rip
out that for th’ pres’nt comp’ny 1” He held out
in one hand the dictionary open at the “Appendix
of Foreign Phrases,” and with his other fore-
finger pointed out the phrases wdiich he wished
interpreted. Bill stared, and the carmine of his
dissoluteness and of his shame vanished together.
Grey-green, like the salt-bush scrub near by, was
his quivering face.
“Look y’ere, coves,” went on Ned. “He’s a
college chap, an’ can’t tell yer what tnau— mo,

THE BAD BOY.
State Premier Carruthers nowadays lives ill a political sense by finding imaginary grievances against the Australian Parliament, by
speaking severely about imaginary injuries done by it to N.S.W., and by posing as a valiant individual who is saving his State from imaginary,
destruction. In fact, he diverts attention from his own mismanagement by being the soured small boy who sticks out his tongue a

WE do not recommend the “ HELBA ” because it is lower in price
than others, such may be true, but because the “ riELBA ’’
excels all others in the most important quality an instrument can
possess— TONE.
This is the result of the superior quality of the alloy used in the
reeds, and the employment of experts in reed “ voicing,” an art which is
imperfectly understood by the ordinary maker of Accordeons.
The “ riELBA ” ACCORDEON, No. 717, is fitted with three
sets of reeds, nine fold double bellows, leather lined corners fitted with
metal protectors.
To anyone mentioning The Bulletin we will send the above Post

THE BENEFACTOR.
In the course of an address on Socialism to a meeting of the Women’s Liberal League, at North Sydney, the other evening, Mrs. Osborne said that there were many different
kinds of Socialism but they were all alike, inasmuch as the object was to repress individuality and to increase the power of the State. The lecturer quoted Milton’s line: “To
disenthrone the King of Heaven, we war, if war we must,” in support of the theory that Satan was the first Socialist.— Newspaper Item.

MARRYING HIM TO THE WRONG WOMAN.
A remarkable incident occurred at a wedding ceremony in Ballarat on Wednesday afternoon. The celebrant mistook an elder lady who was present for-the bride,and put
the usual questions to her instead of. to the other. When the ring was about to be placed on her finger the bridegroom, observing the bride agitation said, ""What is the matter,
my girl? Don’t you feel well?” and the bride timorously replied, “I think there must be some mistake.” Well, who is really marrying this man?"" asked the clergyman.
“Please, sir, I am!” responded the youthful bride. —Daily Paper.
Mr. Wade started his campaign against the Referendum proposals last night. —Daily Paper.
THE BRIDEGROOM : “Here, what’s your game? That sour hobble-skirt isn’t the girl I’m marrying—it’s the other one.”

celebrated ten-part pea! of Orandsire Triples ” ftt St.
'Philip’s Church in three hours tifiaen minutes, also re-
corded two peals of “ Grandsiro Minor ”at St. Mark’s,
Darling point one conducied’by Mr. Harry Adams,
and tbeotherby Mr. Jno. Beeohoy on Tuesday last, Uu
Thursday the team and their friends were entertained
by the St. Philip’s Society,
Mr. Mor on gave the fo*at of “ The l.end wo live in,""
and eulogised the freedom and liberty we enjoyed under
its laws. Speaking of bells, he said that “ scientific
change ringing ” was not a source of pleasure to nil,
but he was sure its ooponents were in a minority, and
that all who had the good of their adopted land
at heart would even put up with u little
inconvenience to hoar those chin es rung, re-
calling to many times and scenes of long ago.'
Mr, Whitton proposed “ Success to Bellringing,” and
hoped further successes would follow the one recently
achieved. Mr. W. Albinson, in responding, expressed
a hope that Sydney ring- rs would pui forth ai) iheir
energies, and that the m xi peal might ha rung by New
South Waies_ m-n. Mr. H. Adams then, in feeling
terms, gave ""The health of St. Philip’s society.”
coupled with the name of their conductor, Mr, John
Dennis, and said that ibis visit wopld be over remem-
bered by himself and brother ringers, not only as a red-
letter day in the annals of colonial iluging, but lor tbo
hearty wefl-ome that had been extenoed 10 them, aud
the generous manner in which they had been enter-
tain d. Mr Dennis having responded on behalf el St.
Philip’s, si d in reference to p -al-riuginghe was somo-
wcat doubtful as to whether they would bo able to
follow in the footsteps of the return success achieved
by tbe visiting team, for they were heavih handicapped
by being situated in a neighbourhood of private
dwellings, and this caused numerous applications to
have Ibe bells silenced. ■*, e.

“ London, July 7. —The Australian Eleven endure
the inevitable inflictions of ‘ interviewers,’ photo-
graphers, tradesmen, and so forth, with what patience

(Consider that this type of fish, which is very rare,
is responsible for all the stories about the supposed

“Mr. Robert states that about 4 p./m. on

Charlotte Cove, about a mile below the
Garden Island Cove Creek jetty, he
saw some creature in the water
which was quite unknown to him.
It had, when first seen, elevated
a long neck about 20ft. out of
the water, with a triangular-
shaped flat head bent at
right angles to the
neck.”
No, there is not much gate-money in

Rev. Mervyn Archdall, M.A., was received with tremendous applause as he rose to move the first resolution, which was worded as follows “ That this meeting protests against any alteration
being made in the form of the Coronation Oath and Declaration of the Sovereigns of Great Britain, on the following grounds, viz. : —That by the Act of Settlement it is decreed that the Sovereign of
these realms shall be of the Protestant baith; that the aggressive claims and attitude of the Roman Catholic Church are such that it is necessary that there shall be no relaxations of the safeguards
which ensure the continuance of the Protestant succession; that, as the Roman Catholic doctrine of mental reservation permits oaths to be taken in other than their generally-accepted meaning, it is
incumbent on the Sovereign to make his declaration in terms that are not capable of being taken in any other than their ordinary and obvious meaning, and to declare his adhesion to the Protestant
Faith in terms that cannot be misunderstood.

Shrapnel Green
DO you remember on Shrapnel Green,
On that far-off bitter November day,
When the snow lay thick, and the wind blew keen,
And the blanketed dead in a long row lay,
When your gaze went over the tideless sea
Where rode the monitors grey and grim,
The words you said when you turned to me
With voice grown husky, and eyes grown dim.
You watched for a moment a ’plane’s swift climb,
And you said, as a great gun belched its flame:
“Surely to God there will be a time
When men won’t come at this devilish game!
Have you forgotten the words you spoke
When the dead in their blankets lay very still,
The words you said in a voice that broke,
With a monitor searching for Beachy Bill,
And Imbros rising across the sea,
And a fast ’plane sliding across the sky—
To the left a rattle of musketry,
And we poor fools in a world awry,
Pausing awhile in our bitter task
To wonder vainly what it could mean?
Have you forgotten, old mate, I ask
The prayer you uttered on Shrapnel Green?
Did you catch a gleam from a vanished age ?
Did you hear an echo from other years?
Did you catch a murmur of ancient rage
And see sad eyes that were dim with tears?
Did you see men figHt for an ancient wrong
As men would fight in the years to come?
Did you see the galleys and hear the song
Of victors homing from Ilium?
What had you seen when you turned to me?
Whence came the prayer that I heard you say
When your gaze went over the old, old sea
On that far-off bitter November day?
To Shrapnel Green there has come once more
The quiet dreams that the great guns broke;
Men have returned to the ways of yore.
But one remembers the words you spoke
With a monitor shelling along the right,
And shrapnel bursting above Lone Pine,
And the shell-torn Green ’neath its pall of white,
And the blanketed dead in a long still line.
I know not whither your path has led,
Your name’s forgotten, but this I know.
The world has need of the prayer you said
On Shrapnel Green in the long ago.
Westralia. OSCAR WALTERS.

Carruthers : “Can’t say I really see any bruises on the

A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE,
The Opposition has abandoned the ground of policy and is contenting itself with a campaign of onseruputous calumny and abuse. The reason given for the adoption of this
course is the extraordinary one that the Government has stolen all the Opposition's legislative trump cards. Even if the Government had committed the tlueft of Mr. McGowen's
precious policy, as it is charged with having done, that act from a sincere politician in the Opposition leader’s place might he expected to evoke quite a different kind of feeling. He
Caucus from being carried into effect.-Sydney TELEGRAPH.
McGOWEN: “Look here, these are my clothes you’ve got on.”
WA DE: ""My dear sh, clothes were made to be worn, You say they are good clothes, so you should be glad to see me wear them. It
is a compliment to you. It shows that I appreciate your taste. Every man whose goods are stolen should be grateful to the thief.""

“SECRETS OF THE BALLROOM.”
WANTON WOMEN RENOUNCED.
MELBOURNE, Sunday,—The Rev. George
Gladstone, incumbent ot Holy Trinity Church,
Nathalia, preached to-night on “Secreta of the
Ballroom,” taking for his text, ""They have be-
gun to wax wanton.” The church was crowded,
and the rev. gentleman's remarks werb received
with frequent expressions of dissent, and also
with laUghter J'e had noticed, he said, the most
wanton women in Nathalia were church-
goers, but they did not attend his church, hav-
ing been driven out. The ballroom was a char-
nel house, where those who attended brushed
shoulders with wantons and harlots. A wanton,
he said, was a married woman who had one hus-
band, and wanted two or three more. Tho
women of Goulburn Valley were cursed with tho
spirit Of wantonness, and next time they saw
in the local press the names of married women
attending these white corrobaries they would
know them as wantons —as women who had one
husband a piece, but who wished tor more.

THE PARSON OR THE TIGER.
“The Sunday Opening of Sydney Zoo. — lb was reported at the monthly meeting of the East Sydney Ministers’ Association, held yesterday morning in the
Bourke-street Congregational School-hall, that the action of the Government in subsidising the Zoological Gardens for the purpose of admitting the public free
on Sundays had already considerably affected the attendance of children at the Sunday schools in the district. And it was resolved unanimously that the free admis-
sion of children to the Zoo on Sundays, on the plea of educational advantages, is unnecessary, as all children of the public schools are admitted free on certain week-
days; and, further, that it is wrong for Government to vote money to secure for one section of the community privileges of which another section cannot
conscientiously avail itself.”— Daily Paper.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1900.
Prior 6d.
London, Friday Afternoon.— The
allied forces are in possession of 100 mom-
bars of the Emperor of China’s harem.
“ If,” cabled Premier Lyne to Chamberlain, “if you want any
more Australian troops to fight for Old Mother Country in her
V hour of peril in China, now is the time ! Say the
\ word, and I could raise 15,000 men in
w. N.S.W. within 24 hours.”

DEPARTURE OF THE GOVERNORR
By the stirring incidents of last week
N.S.W. was left without a Governor.
'lt is officially reported that
Prince Tuan, having shaved his head,
has fled to Mongolia in the disguise
of a monk,'’
In other words he shaved his head
to save it.
The above is a labored joke ; |
in fact, it was made by Chinese cheap I
labor, and Hop. holds himself in no
wise responsible for it.
“It is reported that the steamship
owners hare been approached by a Sydney
firm with a suggestion that they should pre
sent a State barge to convey the Governor-
General to his official landing-place. A
design has been prepared for the vessel.""
Mr Lyne at first thought that one of the barges belonging to the Works Department might do.
• Only,” explained Mr. O’SuKvan, “since I came into office all our barges have been kept .so busy in
earning out necessary works originating in this brain that really I couldn't spare even a mud-scow.""

Dyspeptic Emesis
A LONG PERIOD OF SUFFERING.
A Permanent Cure in Newtown,
The Case of Mrs. G. WALKER-
(For the “Independent.”)
A subject necessarily inviting to all, and
the discussion of which has of late years
employed many able pens, was recently
touched upon by Mrs. Gertrude Wall er, of
No. 17 George-street, Newtown, when chat-
ting with our special representative.
•‘lt is in reference to the most effective
means of getting rid of one’s j ersonal
enemies that I wish to speak to you,” said
Mrs Walker, “ and I think that I am
entitled to speak on the subject because my
liver was out of order for a long time and
my sufferings were extraordinary. I am
twelve 3 ? ears older sinoe my troubles beg n
with an attack 01 neuralgia, which I
endured for three months without abate-
ment. The teirifle pains lodge !in the back
of my head at first, then they affected my
gums, which became very sore, making it
impossible to properly mas Date my food,
and ‘hen the tortures shot up to my eyes.
Later on there was not a part of my head
which escaped the maddening agonies of
neuralgia, and often I thought they would
drive me out of my mind.”
“ I expect you gob but very little sleep ? ”
enquired the writer.
“Sleep was de»/.ed me altogether,” re-
spond'd Mrs. Walker. “Often I have paced
the floor for hours when everybody else has
been fast asleep, ar;d when morning came I
was not fit for anything. My n rves were
all of a shake, nervousness having such a
hold upon me that I was afraid of my own
shadow, and w en a knock came to the door
it caused me to tremble so violet tly that I
could scarcely move. I was afraid at every
turn, an idea being in my mind continually
that somebody was standing behind me,
though when I looked round there was
_itabody, and I could on'y teproaeh myself
for my folly. Still, I could not help feeling
timid, and to be so every moment of the day
had the effect of making me fretful and
despondent. I lost flesh till I became as
thin as a skeleton, for which I blame my
poor appetite and the trouble I had in keep-
ing my food down. My stomach was in a
dreadfully weak condition, a fact which
accounted for the frequent fits of von iring
I had, for it was all the same in < fleet w hut
kind of food I took—it would not stay
down. Many a time I thought I was going
to be suffocated by the sense of oppression
in my chest, for when it w. s at iis worst I
had to gasp for breath in a most a'arming
way. I could not make out what was
wrong a little distance below my neck.
There seemed to be something pricking me
there—a very tantalising sensation—although
at other times the pain was as gieat as if I
had strained myself. I cani.ot imagine
anything more vile than the taste which was
in my mouth, and to make it mere un-
pleasant still there was a coating on my
tongue which made me feel quite sick. On
arising from bed I was distressed by the aches
running through my legs and across my
loins, for they set at difiance any attempt I
might make to do any light work about the
house, although at the best of tim< s I was
so easily overpowered by exhaustion that I
had to let matters take their own course.”
Did you obtain advice from any
source ? ”
“ I should rather think so. A doctor
from Sydney was doing his best for me, yet
1 cannot say there was anything latisfacio y
resulting from his treatment. lam sure his
medicines did not benefit me, because my
internal troubles multiplied week by week.
If 1 walked a few yaids I was biought to a
standstill by an attack if giddiness, and on
many occasions when I walked a little
distance in the garden a mysterious sensa-
tion come over me which made it appear
that the further I walked the fmthcr the
fence seemed to be away. And then my
heart gave rise to serious reflections The
slight eat excitement or exertion always caused
it to flutter and throb, but even when I was
sitting still it used to suddenly start pal-
pitating with such vengeance that its
beatings could be heard quite distinctly.
The shaip pains which ran through my heart
f'om time to time also lent color to the idea
that it wasdiseased inse me wayor other, and
as the physio I was taking did not alleviate
my sufferings in the least, it appeared
certain that I was going to be an invalid
for life. With my yellow skin and my
features distorted by the physicial agony
and the anxitty of mind I was enduring, I
looked as if my days were almost numbered,
but now, thank Ifeaven, there is a great
difference in my t ppcanim e, and although
I am over thirty years of age, I feel as young
and active as a girl of sixteen.”
“Can you account for such a wonderful
transformation. ”
“ Easily Clements Tonic did it, and only
for an old fiiend who told me about that
medicine I might still be suffering, or per-
haps be dead, as nothing else could cure me.
Several days passed before I felt any better
by taking Clements Tonic, and I was
beginning to think that it was no benefactor
of mine, but I kept on with it and then I
comm, need to feel revived. The neuralgic
pains, I noticed, were dying away, and then
they suddenly stoj ped ; but although this
was a great relief, I w s n.oie c<nceined
about my internal organs, and I was in a
state of painful suspense as to whether
Clements Tonic was equal to the occasion.
Sure enough it was. I became regular in
all my habits, freed from the unpleasant
taste in my mouth, my tongue was cleansed,
and 1 had an appetite to < njoy my food.
The wind which used to arise.from my
stomach did n< t form now, and I never had
the least inclination to vomit my food. I
thought this was a remarkably satisfactory
test of the merits of Clements Tonic,
and when my first purchase was exhausted
I got more, as I meant to get quite well
whilst I had the chance. From that time
onwards I gained strength by leaps anel
1 oun s. As regular’}'as I lay down to test,
I had calm and refreshing sleep, and I
diel appreciate it after passing so many
wrehhed nights not hng before. Ths
freedom with which I could draw my breath
was evidence that my digestive organs -/ere
being benefited I y the use of Clements
Tonic, and as my heart had resun ed its
norm 1 pulsation, without e\ er paining me
either, I knew that it was not diseased, but
that my anxious fears had been induced by
the bad st te of my iver. For my nervous
system In re was nothing I had taken which
could appioach Clements Tonic for general
excellence, as my nerves were-left without
a tremor and I could walk anywhere in the
daik without any fear. By adhering
to the use of Clements Tonic for some weeks
I became as healthy as I have ever been, and
for several years my constitution has been
perfectly sound. If these admisssons will
assist people similarly afflicted, you may
publish them in any way you please.”

G. REID’S PIECE OF COLD IRON.
According to a return presented to N.S.W. Parliament by Premier Reid, certain Government stores which cost £10,132 in N.S.W., cost, in Victoria, £21,069. “That,” said
G. H. Reid, “is a piece of cold iron for Protectionists to chew.” The figures have since been proved to be erroneous in almost every particular, and the official who is alleged to have drawn
them up has been called on for an explanation.

JOSEPH IS UP AGAINST IT.
Australia has veen staggered, in moderntion, by the news that its great Cook and Bottlewasher Ministry is preparing a measure by which the Common-
wealth is to take over the State debts. This is a great idea-a most commendable idea-and the matter should have been attended to long ago. If Cook
carries it out on a satisfactory basis, ""The Bulletin"" will hall him (to his great surprise. and to its great surprise also) as the greatest financier Australia has
produced.-""The Bulletin,"" 4/9/'13.

“SONS OF THE EMPIRE.-PROPOSED TABLET IN
ST. PAUL’S.
“London, Tuesday.— A cartoon showing the Princess Louise’s
design for a bronze memorial is now on exhibition in St. Paul’s
Cathedral. The design shows an angel with outstretched wings lean-
ing tenderly over a figure of the crucified Redeemer. It is intended
for a tablet commemorating the deeds of the colonial sons of the
Empire in the late war.”
“ London, 20th October.—Mr. Cresswell was examined yesterday
before the Rand Native Labor Commission. He stated that the chair-
man of the London directorate of his company had written to him
privately to the effect that Messrs. Wernher, Beit and Co. and other
Rand mining magnates had been consulted on the question of employ-
ing unskilled white labor, and that they were adverse. They feared
that the engaging of a large number of white laborers on the Rand
would ‘ cause the same troubles as had prevailed in Australia,’ and
would enable a combination of labor to dictate the rates of wages,
and to dictate also politically when responsible government came to
be established in the Transvaal.”

play. The WilliamstdWn team left the ground,
and their opponents remaining until time was up,

The match between Fitzroy and South Mel-

The drought is fierce and the drought is fell,

The cattle are a-dyin’ and the sheep are dead;
The folks are famished but the crows are fed;
There’s no fine talk for a fight like this,
No beer at call with a girl to kiss :
It’s a slouch that’ll stand it when the heroes roam ;
O, the Lord will hustle for the folks at home 1
So fling*your flags on the mornin’ breeze—
(This “ Duty first! ” is a poor old wheeze).
There’s drums and fifes and a fine old flare—
(A plague and curse on the old black care !)
A man must go when the bugles cry,
Though the young ones droop and the old ones die ;
It’s a slouch that lingers when the heroes roam ;

from which it has never recovered, and which was responsible, in a large measure, for the banking crises of a few years afterwards-well, I tell you that that strike
would be only a swaddling infant compared to the gigantic upheaval that would result from a strike to-day. It is either that or the Arbitration Court, and employers

“ Mr. Reid’s speech last night practically indicates his extraordinary
contortionist attitude on the Convention Bill. No great public measure
was ever more effectively damned with faint praise. And yet, after
nearly two hours’ candidly hostile criticism of the measure, he startled
and staggered his audience by declaring his intention to vote for it. Mr.
Reid has been straddling on the Federal rail ever since the Convention
closed. . . '. His acceptance of the Bill as it is framed, even when
given somewhat reluctantly, is embarrassing to his friends and supporters
in,local politics.” —Syd. Daily Telegraph.

BASE INGRATITUDE.
If it be true, as alleged, that money is being withdrawn from Australia, it is a matter of great satisfaction. There have been times when this country
required all the money that could be obtained from any source whatever, but that is not the case now. Never before was there such an abundance of capital.
They had much better send their money where it is required.— Palmer’s Sydney Share-Market Circular.
COHEN: “Oh, the injustice of it! Vy, his friends tell him not to borrow any more moneysh from me just pecause he don’t vant it. And

In order to mitigate the serious unemployed trouble in Great Britain the Admiralty ordered five new cruisers to be constructed by private shipbuilding firms. The

John Bull gives his famishing unemployed a cup of water, while his protected neighbor helps himself by the bucketful.

Tl\e Finger Post to Health.
This is an Interesting Story
for Liver Sufferers.
The casts of
Mr. G. HEATHCOTE.
(BY A SPECIAL REPORTER.)
Since enlightened humanity requires that
the trials incidental to sickness should be
minimised wherever possible, and since by
kindliness and consideration much can be
done in that direction, a reporter called
upon Mr. George Heathcote, of Surry-
street, Waterloo, who willingly assented
to answer any questions.
“ Were you once a resident of Bunda-
berg, Queensland? ” asked the pressman.
“ Yes,” answered Mr. Heathcote. “ I
was living there when it was necessary to
cross the bridge by boat instead of walking
over it, or, to be more explicit, during the
time of the great flood, and it was during
that exciting and disastrous period that my
blood was so impoverished through exces-
sivi ly hard work for long hours at a stretch
that sores broke out on my hands and arms,
and my legs swelled terribly. Previous to
this I had suffered from fever and ague,
which left me very weak and shaky, and
for some weeks I noticed that my appetite
was falling off ; but I put that down to
fatigue more than anything else, until other
symptoms cropped up to show me it was
not so, but my liver and kidueys which
were responsible.”
“ What reasons were there to enable you
to arrive at that conclusion ? ”
“ Any number of them, one of the most
unmistakable being a nasty pnin which
caught me here (Mr. Heathcote indicated
the part affected by placing his hand on the
small of his back'. My back ached so in-
tensely that my wife made flannel belts for
me to wear, thinking that they would afford
me some relief. If I was doing anything
whi' h caused me to bend down, the pain on
straightening myself was something terrible,
while walking also provoked great distress
and inconvenience. Other proof that my
kidneys were in a bad way was also in
evidence, and as for the rest of my ail-
ments —well, I hardly know where to begin
first. ”
“ 1YU me a few of the mort important —
ihose that are uppermost'in your mind ? ”
“ Oh ! I have not forgotten any of them,”
was the quick response, “especially the
heavy feelings in my chest, which made me
short-winded. After eating, a weighty sen-
sation appeared in that quarter, and before
I knew where I was my stomach began
swelling out with wind, which made me
very uncomforta 1 le. always, and at times
gave rise to sharp, cutting pains. The
sour gases gradually worked their way up,
and caused me to belch, after which, and
until 1 took a little more food, I felt
slightly easier, but the same unpleasantness
followed each meal, however trifling. When
making my morning preparations for work
I used to feel as if I would'tike to go back
to bed again, as I was entirely devoid of
energy, and bed no desire to attempt any-
thing. This languidness was due, no doubt,
to the restlessness every night. I could go
to bed feeling so drowsy that my eyes
seemed swollen for the want of rest, yet I
found myself awake the greater part of the
night, and when I got up my limbs were
all aches. Nearly every day I was dis-
tracted with intense headaches- which ap-
peared to bring a mist befrire lay eyes, as
if my sight was failing me, and without any
warning my head became so giddy that I
had to take a rest till the sen-ation passed
away. Every month I was getting weaker
and more wretched, being continually be-
set with pains under my shoulder-blades,
which travelled right through to the heart,
and caused me considerable anxiety. The
white coating on my tongue explained the
unhealthy condit ; on of my stomach, too,
and what I wanted was a real good medicine
to clear away all disorders and impurities;
but in those days I did not know as much
as I do now, or I would have been out of
my troubles very quickly. I went from
bad to worse, and had arrived at that
melancholy and desperate stage when the
least an>l most simple thing excites a feeling
of irritation, and I am sure yon will admit
that such a life of misery is not worth eu-
(luring. Had I gone on a little longer in
that sorry plight I question whether I
would have been as sound a man as I am
to-day, for I was fairly in the grip of my
complaint, when, owing to the recollection
of some conversations between a few of my
friends, 1 hit upon the idea of taking some
Clements Toir’c. I took immediate action,
as I firmly bel’eved that further delay
would have brought irretrievable disaster
to my.constitution.”
“ Your good fortune came at a very ac-
ceptable time, I should imagine?”
“ Yes ; and a very critical time, too, and
I regretted that I had not bought a few
bottles of Clements Tonic at the outset;
but we all have to buy our experience, you
know, although I intend doing all I can to
help ot her sufferers by letting them know
what Clements Tonic can do. Personally,
I can truthfully say that it generally re-
vived me from my lethargic state when I
had drank but a small quantity, and I found
myself rapidly improving. Clements Tonic
had a magical effect on my kidneys and
greatly reHe- ed the pains about my back
and shoulders. This relief, collided wi h
the abatement of my headaches, had tho
effect of mating me feel more restful at
nights, and the sound sleep 1 got through
using Clements Tonic did me an immense
amo int of good. My slumber was not in-
terfered with by dreams, and when I awo e
a* the usual time for getting up I arose with
alacrity and hastened to my morning meal,
after which I was ready for work. It was
a marvellous change to be full of energy
and cheerfulness again, but the invigorating
properties of Clements Tonic were so re-
markable that I could not have restrained
my feelings of joy had I wanted to. Wind
never formed in my stomach after Clements
Tonic got to work, neither did my chest
trouble me, while in the matter of palpita-
tion tho same medicine was equal to the
prevailing reqniremeti's. There is no
denying the fact that Clements io.uc
was wonderfully effective as a blood
purifier, for the sores were gradiiai;y
effaced from my hands and arms, and the
cause of my legs swelling—whatever that
cause might have been was entirely re-
moved. My illness had considerably
affected my nerves, which became shaky
whenever 1 was disturbed, but to my heart-
felt thankfulness I must say that Clements
Tonic was as effective on my nervous
system as it was on my other deranged
organs.” _
“ VVliat was your appetite like then .
“As it was soon after commencing or.
Clements Tonic—very good, indeed, and it
has remained so ever since. But the
strengthening qualities of my newly-found
medicine surprised me, fur altli 'Ugh my
work was very heavy I always g<>t through
it without feeling any ill effects from the
time Clements I onic cured mo, aiul I have
not once lmd the faintest return of any of
my old symptoms, in acknowledgment of
which I give you permission to publish my
story as it pleases you.”

BRITAIN’S FREE BREAKFAST TABLE.
Lord Rosebery says that Britain will never tolerate a tax on food; the “free breakfast table ” must be held inviolate.
The British Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (which makes the table to put the free breakfast on) reports for January this year
that in 495 towns or cities of the United Kingdom trade is “bad” (through so few people being able to afford the price of the table); in 213 it
is “ moderate; ” and it isn’t “ good ” in one single place. Wages for skilled workmen range as low as fivepence and one-eighth of a penny per hour.
Apparently the imported British Freetrade breakfast is eaten on the floor these days.

attempt to belittle the House, and troat it as
occupying the position of the Legislative Councils
of the different States The House was appar
ently to be treated by the Ministry in the matter
of publio expenditure simply as a Chamber oL

Sir J. Madden not only draws a salary of £3500
a year as Chief-Justice, but he also draws £5OOO a
year as Libutenant-Governor, bringing his official
income up to £B5OO, in addition to which he is
provided with an official residenoe at “ Stonning-
i !""?*?» Toorak. His Excellency does not occupy
otonmngton ” just now, on the plea that it is too
from Melbourne, but he is at liberty to use it
if he felt so disposed. The Government is anxious
Jto bring the matter to a termination, but the
.leisured run of tho correspondence is stringing the
negotiations out for an unconscionable time. Steps
are now being taken by the Ministry to ascertain
wbat the Secretary of State for the Colonies in-
tends to do in the matter.

have been bagged.

After a lesson In Nature-study recently, a St. Kilda
school boy caught a young frog, and was explaining It
to-a mate who llatened with open-mouthed receptivity.
The frog took advantage of so good an opening for
escape, andf Jumping Into the boy’s mouth, stuck fast in
,hM throat. (At least so says the Argus.)

The Sydney Telegraph cordially recommends a certain place near Canberra as a capital site on account of the excellent shooting and fishing to
be obtained there. Apparently the paper thinks that the wild animals will remain even after the city is built, and that the metropolis of
Australia will lead a sporting outdoor life like this.

AN ANCIENT PARABLE (EVERY PAR-
ABLE OUGHT TO BE ANCIENT) FOR
JAWBONE NEILD. CONROY AND CO.
Once upon a time a Bulldog and a very elo-
quent Cockatoo inhabited the same yard.
Now, the' Bulldog slept pretty constantly, and
the Cockatoo, to take a rise out of him, used to
hop down and whisper in his ear, “ Sool ’em,
Bully ' ” Whereupon Bully would arise and bark
furiously and strain on his chain, only to find
that there was nothing to sool
Bully resolved to see who was fooling him.
So he slept one ""day with one eye open. When
the Cockatoo next tried to pull his leg, he grabbed
a big mouthful of feathers from that bird’s tail.
And as Cocky, mounted once more on his
perch, ruefully viewed his bald and 'bleeding tail,
he sorrowfully soliloquised “ What is the matter
with me I —Ah 1 / know • Too mucbC blanky

are making inquiries direct whether any other governmental body in Australia is requiring money, since plenty of funds are available on the same terms.” — Cable.

This, if you like, is a portrait of
the editor of The Watchman —halo
and all—taken at the moment of
writing ungallant things about the
scarlet young person of Babylon.
And here we have another God-tearing editor—Rev. W. H. Fitchett, of
Life. Mr. Fitchett does not wear his halo during business hours. He thinks
i- conduces to baldness. It will be seen in the upper right-hand corner of
the picture, hanging on a nail.
JOURNALISM IN THE NEVER-NEVER.—Behold here the “brains” of the
Back-Blox Thunderer. His back Is toward us, bat it is easy to see by his
strenuous attitude that he is rubbing up the Kaiser or the Czar the wrong way.
As an interesting companion picture to the last, is a busy day in the sans*
turn of a “ Qreat Daily.” Editor Ward’s whiskers have many admirers.

THAIfKT REFORMATION, lfl
The Rev. C. C. Dunstau said he rose with a deep V
s enae of the responsibility which he had incurred iu
to a request to address the meeting. Still
ire considered it an honour and privilege to be asso-
ciated with 1 the Reformation Festival. To say there
were many in the bonds of common churchmanship
who were trying to lead Anglicans back to the re-
ligious conditions of pre-Reformation times might be
unpleasant; to say that not a few who had been
cradled and nourished in the Church of England
wet q aping and adopting produces and assimilating,
sentences and doctrines against which their own
CJtui'cb protested, or that many were acting traitor- .
ously who were trying to effect a compromise in
which the Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic |
Church could never be united, was also unpleasant,
I but these statements were true. (Hear. hear.) He felt
that that meeting, if it were given the opportunity,
would rise and say, “ Thanh God for the Reform?- I
tion.” ""■»

Melbourne, Sunday.—At a dinner to

opinion that Australian citizen soldiers 3
would never learn thoroughly what dis- 1

in war. The great difficulty in military

A peculiar find of gold has, It Is said, been made by a
resident of* Linton. A goose was killed, and on being
opened, rough specks of gold were found, the lot being
about three-quarters of a penny-
weight, valued at 38.. Evidently
the gold had been picked up
whilst the goose was feeding on
the roads. '
Our artist here depicts a veteran who
has been thoroughly “disciplined.”
Practical discipline is all right, but
there’s such a thing as over-doing it.
A well known firm of London pub-
lishers has brought out a series of pic-
tures to “Advertise Australia,” one of
which shows a squad of convicts drawn
up on the sloping shores of Sydney
Cove, and being addressed by an official
regarding their future career. The
series has been withdrawn.
Intending Emigrant: “Look ’ere,Nance,
If they makes long speeches to their
immygrants when the’ arrives let’s
go som’eres else.”
It Is safe to predict that the geese of Linton are going to have a
pretty warm time of it in the future.

An interesting opinion on the point
was given by a legal authority, who
maintains that an action for trespass

is, he points out, a well-known princi-
ple of law that a freeholder owns the

“THE FIVE NATIONS.”
LONDON, Wednesday.—The TIMES states this morning that the Dominions are being driven at a dozen points into the practical world of politics on their own account, and
are acquiring interests sometimes conflicting with Britain’s. Unless there is a mutual understanding, the five nations will find it impossible to continue the system whereby British
foreign policy remains a sealed book to all but one partner. “It is necessary,” the paper adds, “that our policy be strengthened by becoming Imperial and securing the
conscious and continuous support of the Governments overseas.”
DR. ASQUITH: “ This little chap looks as though he’s sickening for yellow fever.”

There was once a Small Boy who offered a Large Dog a Bit of Meat. It wasn’t his Dog Either. There was a String attached to the Meat and
when the Dog reached for the Meat the Small Boy snatched it Away and Laughed. He did this to show his Importance and to assert his State
Frights, for the Small Boy didn’t require the Meat and he had no Business with the Large Dog. in the end the Large Dog chased the Small Boy

They were shocked at the proposed eviction of the Governor-General from Sydney Government House, and offered to pay the rent to the end of
Denman's term. It the offer was accepted the least his Ex. could do would be to invite his three landlords to all social functions, and receive l

LONDON, Saturday. Among the dis-
tinguished scientists attending the Zoological
Conference at Cambridge is, Professor
Haeckel, whose researches with regard to
natural development and evolution have
been of great value
At the sitting of the conference yesterday,
Professor Haeckel referred to the import-
ance attaching to the discoveries of fossils
in lava during recent years, and said that
it was no longer a hypothesis that man
belonged to the primal order of lemur.
Conclusive proof--’had been afforded that
'monkeys and men were descended- from a
common stem.

IN THE PUBLIC EYE.
The constant sneer or curse or lamentatlon of the two Sydney Foreign-trade morning papers about ""Victorian Manufactures,” while N.S.W.
manufactures are never even mentioned by them, is at last leading the outside public to believe that the Ma State has no factories of its own.
The Herald and Telegraph tell the world every day about “Victorian manufactures” as if they were the only ones in Australia. As “natural
consequence the outside person begins to see with his mind’s eye things similar to the above.

COMPOSITION, BY A BOY
13 YEARS OLD.
“Sir, —You ask me how
1 spent King’s Birthday.
Well, my father called me
to get the cows at 4 a.m.
“Then 1 pumped water for the cows,
and gave them some feed, while my
brother got the horses ready to deliver
the milk in round the
town.
“We drove in and
delivered the milk, and
got back at half-past 7.

Then had breakfast.
“ I got up and drove them in.
I milked nine.
“After breakfast I turned the separ-

pumped more water for the cows, and
gave them more feed.

Before Taking Clements Tonic,
MISERY & HELPLESSNESS.
After Taking Clements Tonic,
CHEERFULNESS & ACTIVITY.
A Very Convincing Narrative.
The Case of Mr. P. B. HUNT,
(BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.)
The ready compliance of Mr. Percy
Bordon Hunt, of No. 8 The Terrace,
Bourke-street, Redfern, with the request
of a special interview, illustrates a
series of difficulties and complica-
tions from which there was no immediate
prospect of escape. After mentioning that
he was a native of London and a resident of
these colonies for the last ten years, Mr.
Hunt went on to say :
“ It was when I came out to this country
that I had a very bitter experience with bad
health, and I hope I shall never have to go
through anything like it again, as once in a
life-time is quite enough. I had previously
suffering from a complaint called locemotor
ataxia, and I had never felt really well since.
The change in climate evidently did not
suit me, for my head started to ache most
unmercifully, making me feel quite unfit to
take part in anj thing- I was so drowsy
and low-spirited, too, no pleasant thoughts
ever coming to give me a moment’s happi-
ness, and I did not seem to care what
happened.”
“ Did you receive any medical attention?”
asked the writer.
“Yes. I had been to several hospitals,
where the doctors prescribed physic for me,
but it could not have been suitable for my
complaints, as it took no effect upon me.
Their medicines were so useless that I might
as well have thrown them down the drain.
The doctors said it was next to impossible
to properly recover from 'the complaint
which had made a wreck of me, and this was
and awful reflection for one who had always
been so hale and hearty before, and naturally
making me more sad and hopeless than ever ;
but I thought I would try some other
medicine before giving up all hope, and
when I had done so my condition was just
as bad as ever. I could not get my breath
freely owing to the heavy sensation in my
chest, and 1 could not sleep at all well. If
I did doze off I was made restless by
dreams that were most repulsive, and, once
more finding myself awake, I dreaded the
thought of falling asleep again because the
dreams were so unpleasant. That was
through being sc nervous, I suppose, for I
trembled at the slighest noise and was
excited at every turn. My mouth had a
nauseating taste which I imagined came
from the white coating on my toi gue. and
there was such a strange feeling about my
eyes—a heavy sensation as if they had
swollen during the night. When in Louden
I was secretary to one of the most eminent
Congregational ministeisin the city, and con-
sequently had a great amount of brain work
to do, so that when I came here and felt so
brain-weary and fagged out I felt my position
all the more keen y. There was no life in
me, and I gave myself up as helpless to
throw oft the utter deadness of vitality
under which I was existing. Simply through
excessive weakness my limbs were racked
with aches. It was just the same in the
morning after lying down all night, for my
legs were as tired as if I had been climbing
steep hills instead of trying to rest myrslf,
and the mere thought of going to work made
me shudder in despair. Ihere was something
radically wrong with my loins, too, as tho
painful aches across them caused me no end
of inconvenience, and more so when I had
to walk to any place. But so far as that
goes there was nothing that I could find any
pleasure in doing, as my loss of energy was
so great that it was almost a trouble to dress
myself, For a man whose temperament is
naturally active and energetic it was a
terrible hardship to be in such a weak and
powerless condition, but the most melancholy
phase of the situation was that I could get
no medicine to help me out of my difficulties.
| It seemed a forlorn hope to think of recover*
ing my health again, but was there anything
I had not given a trial to ? I asked myself. A
little reflection told me that Clements Tonid
had escaped my notice up till now, and ad
my deplorable state of feebleness required
immediate attention I said I would give il
a trial.”
“ Were you pleased that you did so.”
“My word I was, for Clements Tome
acted on my system as no other medicind
had done. Do you know that I had no real
appetite from the time I was taken ill until
I took Clements Tonic, which made me so
hungry that I was always wanting food. ]
was overjoyed at this success, especially as
my pains were diminishing with each bottle
of Clements Tonic,which made my digestive
apparatus able and willing to assimilate my
food and fill my veins with pure, rich 1 lood,
and with my heart strong and vigorous to
pump that blood to every part of my body.
As time went on it became apparent that I
was on the road to recovery, as my head-
aches and giddiness were gone and my sigh!
was good. I breathed freely owing to chest
pains being relieved, while the flatulence
which had affected my stomach did nol
trouble me after using a few bottles ol
Clements Tonic. Would it be possible for
me to speak too well of a medicine which
did so much for me when all others failed!
My opinion is that I will never be able to
liquidate my debt to Clements Tonic for its
miraculous influence over me, for it actually
raised me from misery and helplessness to a
life of cheerfulness and activity. This was
done by degrees, of course, for I got
stronger because I was getting plenty of
rest, my sleep being sound and dreamless,
and the morning life found me equipped for
the duties of life as I had not been for many
a day. I was no longer sickened by a bitter
taste and a dry tongue when I woke up,
neither was I troubled with that weariness
of limb which had made all my movements
so irksome. I had reason to look at life in
an entirely different aspect then, thank Cod,
as tho pain-tilling properties of Clements
Tonic gave such prompt relief tliut I was
soon free from all my torments, and as a
remedy for invigorating the nervous system
I am sui e that medicine is the best in the
world. My nerves were so ready and keen
that my daily work became a pleasure, and
a capacity for physical and mental exc rtiou
proportionally increased. I did not re-
linquish the use of Clements Tonic until my
health was as sound as it had ever been,
being an entirely new man, and as I have
since enjoyed immunity from the ailments
waich nothing but Clements Tonic could
cure it is only fair to my fellow colonists
that I should tell them by what means I
was released from wretchedness.”
“It will be necessary to print your
statements, then.”
“ Of course it will; and you may publkflt
them in any way you like.”

Nervous Prostration
A Dreadful Period of Suffering,
“Clements Tonic Saved Me,”
Tho Case o! Itys. E. WEEDEN.
(BY A SPECIAL REPORTER.)
As great interest was manifested in all
circles respecting the following subject, a
representative waited on Mrs. Elizabeth
Weeden, of No. 67 Cleveland-street, Rcd-
fern, who is well known in the locality in
which she lives.
“ I am pleased that you have called,”
said Mrs. Weeden, “ as it gives me an op-
portunity to let the public know what was
my real position at the time you refer to,
and also to remove any misapprehensions
which might exist in the minds of some of
my neighbours. It appears that the
general assumpti n was that I had profited
in health by following a certain course of
treatment recommended by my doctor. No-
thing of the sort was the case, for after
carrying out his instructions for a long time
my prospects were no brighter, so I gave
him up and tried to get relief through the
aid of several medicines which I had seen
advertised in the papers. They were no
less effective, and as they all failed to reach
the base of my afflictions I thought I wa’s
never going to have my health back again.”
“ What was the nature of your com-
plaint t ” enquired the reporter.
“ The doctor said it was nervous prostra-
tion from which I was suffering, and I think
he was right, for I used to tremble as if an
electric battery was at work all through my
body, while the fearsome state of my mind
was most distressing, as I was always
fancying that some terrible trouble was
hanging over me. If the children were not
home from school to time I worried myself
with the belief that something had happened
to them, and such anxiety seemed to make
me very irritable and short-tempered. I
was alwa\s tired and extremely drowsy,
ft cling at 9 o’clock in the morning as if I
could go to bed and sleep all day, such a
th ng as a desire to get my work done sel-
dom entering my head. Careless and in-
different to everything around me, my life
was one oontinual misery. There was a
depressing pain in my head as if a bai d had
been drawn tightly over my before
which little dark specks frequently floated,
and sometimes I could scarcely see for a
haziness which appeared in front of me. I
used to imagine I had a touch of ear-ache,
owing to a peculiar sensation like the sound
of a bell ring ng in my ears, while the
shocking headaches I had to endure 1 shall
never forget. You have no idea how
wretched I felt when I had eaten a few
mouthfuls of food. My stomach became
filled with wind, from which I suffered great
pain until sour belchings came on, when I
feijt a little easier ; but, in the meant me,
my chest was proving very troublesome,
with a feeling as if a load of some kin 1
was going to smother mo. Then I com-
menced to feel s'ck, and before long my
food was retched up again. I had the most
| awful pains in my side and shoulders; but
the manner in which my heart palp tated
caused me many a fright. If I walke i a few
yards my heart fluttered dreadfully, so you
may depend I exerted myself as little as
possible, more especially as I felt faint and
giddy when I moved about. After the least
effort to do a little work I used to collapse,
my feebleness being so marked that if I
tried to sweep a room my strength failed so
I completely that I ft It powerless, even to
I the tips of my fingers.”
’ “ You spoke about feeling so drowsy all
day. How did you pass your nichts?”
“ Well, I was in such a sluggish condition
that I could always sleep, but the strange
part about it was that I never felt rested or
refreshed. This was due, no doubt, to the
fact that I had horrible dreams and night-
mares, which made me scream out whilst
asleep. The children have often come to
me in the middle of the night to wake me
up ao that my screaming would cease, and
how terrified I w*s when awakened ! My
month was in a nasty state, too, as if I had
been tasting copper, my tongue also being
covered with fur. I thought my skin would
never get white again, it was that yellow,
and I was about as thin as I could pos-
sibly be. Nobody but those who have had
a similar experience to mine can form the
slightest conception of what mental torture
is involved when pain is endured and all hope
is lost. There was no pleasure in being
alive, but still I clung to what little life was
left, and now you see a different woman al-
together. lam quite well again.”
“ You are very fortunate. But what
made you so ? ”
“ It was a medicine called Clements Tonio
which helped me out of my difficulties, and
but for that remedy I do not know what I
would have done. As the doctor’s and
other medic nes could do me no good it is
only right to say that Clements Tonic saved
me, and I shall always deem it my duty to
make this fact clear to other people. Yes,
it was when I had taken nearly a bottle of
Clements Tonic that I felt warmed and
strengthened, with a good healthy glow
running right through my body, and my
spirits brighter than they had been ever
since my illness began. Getting some more
Clements Tonic, that miserable drowsiness
commenced to leave me, and as I was al-
ready taking a little food I began to pick
up strength. I thought this was splendid
progress, and I was highly elated with
the great success which attended my use
of Clements Tonic—a fact that was borne
out by the abatement of my tortures. My
headaches became so insignificant that I
hardly noticed them ; then they died out
altogether, and I can say the same about
the pains in my side and shoulders. I
was so thankful to be thus relieved, and
still more encouragement to per severe with
Clements Tonic came when flatulence was
remedied and ’ the heaviness was lifted
from my chest. The anxiety which my
heart had caused by palpitating at every
turn was readily set aside by Clements
Tonic, which seemed to find its way to
every nook and corner of my internal
organs and root out every particle of
disease which had been left untouched by
previous medicines. '1 he sleep which then
came was calm and refreshing, and when
I got up it was with a clean mouth and
a good appetite for my morning meal,
and also with a feeling of energy which
ma ’e it a pleasure to have some work
to do. All this time my nervousness was
becoming less apparent in every way. I
could soon tolerate any noise without
trembling, and my mind was free from all
fe >rs. I recognised how different my life

Extracts from report of a women's political
meeting (Sydney)
The Chairman : I think the discussion might be
allowed to go on uninterruptedly.
Mrs. Hamilton Grey : You Parliamentary
humbugs !
The Chairman : Order, order.
Mrs. Hamilton Grey (excitedly) : You and your
policemen.
Mr. Levy : Mr. Chairman, she’s got no right to
interrupt the meeting like this.
Mrs. Hamilton Grey : Oh, I’ll go. I don’t
want to stay here.
The Chairman : I must protect these speakers.
Mrs. Hamilton Grey (excitedly): You miserable
coward to go and talk about me as you did. (Dis-
order.)
Mrs. Hamilton Grey then got up, and with a
parting shot at the chairman, left the hall. Mr.
Levy was being asked by the chairman and others
to continue his remarks, when a second lady got
up and attacked the chairman.
Several gentlemen rose, and attempted to calm
the lady, and others spoke about “ women’s rights
with a vengeance,” but the lady continued to talk
excitedly at the chairman for some seconds, and
then left the room. A third lady now rose and
went out, and, quietness being restored, Mr. Lew
proceeded with his address. —Daily paper.
THE NEW WOMAN: WANTED, THE NEW POLICEMAN.

SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON a tree by a river a little bird sat,
Singing, “ Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish ! ”
And I asked, “ Oh ! you naughty bird, what are you at
With your “Fish! Stinking Fish! Stinking Fish?”
Then he said it again, and I thought it absurd,
For he was the Australian Commissioner Bird,
And, of course, London laughed ev’ry time that it heard
His loud “Fish! Stinking Fish! Stinking Fish!”
“ Tell me, bird,” I implored, “why that phrase you repeat?
What is ‘ Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish ? ’
Surely that isn’t what you’re accustomed to eat
in your dear little salary dish !
1 refuse to believe that your owner can be
Such a beast as to give you such things for your tea! ”
But he opened his beak, and he hollered at me:
“ I say * Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish ! ’ ”
N.S.W.
Then I said: “Little Bird, that’s a horrid remark,
That bad ‘ Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish ! ’
Who on earth taught you that as you perched in the dark,
Saying, ‘ Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish ! ’ ?
It is very unpleasant. Your own common°sense
Should have told you it’s Lkely to give much offence.”
But he fluttered and flapped with an effort Immense,
And yelled, “ Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish ! ”
“Little Bird,” I remarked, “ere I finally trek,
Take my word that your ‘Fish! Stinking Fish!’
Will yet make us wring your ridiculous neck!
Don’t you ‘Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish! ’ ”
But the cry was embedded too deep in his brain,
And he knew nothing else. That was perfectly plain,
For he made no reply save to do it again.
Just said : “ Fish ! Stinking Fish ! Stinking Fish! ”
KODAK.
THE WRONG BIRD.
Mr. Sparrow, of London, said at the Chamber of Commerce conference that the Canadian representative in London called out all the time “Canada! Canada!
Canada . Australia required a High Commissioner who would incessantly call out “Australia! Australia! Australia! ”
But, unluckily, if John Forrest or Geo. Reid gets the job the cry is more likely to be something as above.

AFTER YOU!
The Washington correspondent of the New York Times reports that Mr. Roosevelt (Assistant Secretary for the Navy) in a speech said: “The limitation
of armaments will be the thought uppermost at the coming Limitation of Armament Conference, but we must never, under any circumstances, put our country
in a position where it would be unable to defend itself against anything and everything arising. Pacifists and muddle-headed idiots will shout for the United
States to set an example, but we must never disarm, and then wait for other armed nations to act.”

HELL'S MENU
The Devil sat and stroked his tail,
And listened to tho howl and wail.
“ By Eden's Snake,” he said at last,
** Hell’s business is growing fast.
We haven’t got a grid to spare,
Although on some I’ve packed a pair.
Nine months ago things were so slow
I nearly let the license go;
But now, the way trade’s pouring in—
Great Sulphur I What an awful din I ”
Just then the chef dashed through the
door 1
And cast himself upon the floor:
44 Great Lord of Flame and Sheol’s Hob,
1 must resign—l chuck the job.
You hear those cursing souls without?
Just mark their furious yell and shout.
They’re there in tens of thousands—
more!
Each day arrives a thousand score!
And, though I’ve tried by day and night
To satisfy their appetite
With roast and grill and boiled and—
well,
Most everything we’ve got in Hell,
They growl like dogs, dread lord, and so
Give me my wage and let me go.
No cook could stand the strain for long,
However healthy he and strong,
When endless lines of waiters crowd,
And clamor ceaselessly and loud.
Three times a day but this I hear:
** Hi! Sausage one and lager beer ! ”

J. Bull has annexed another 15,000 square miles filled with niggers.
(1) There was a white Bull once. (2) Then he became light brown, and bought a turban. (3) He grew still more brown, and
acquired a big sash and a curved sword. (4) His brownness increased, and he acquired petticoats and funny shoes. (5) Gradually he
became so brown that he was practically black, and he undressed himself again and wore a loin=cloth. (6) And in the end he will
annex so many niggers that he will be quite black, and the last scene will be an aboriginal Bull roasting his ’possum over a small fire.

THE STRENGTH OF IT.
“‘lt is a crowning feat,’ says Sir Ernest Budge, the keeper of the Egyptian and A ssyrian antiquities at the British Museum, apropos the discovery by the Earl of Carnarvon
last week of Tutankhamen’s tomb. Tutankhamen’s predecessor, Amenhotep the Fourth, revived the old sun worship. He shut himself up and isolated the city, where he burnt
incense and offered sacrifices, while the empire went to ruin. There is scarcely a more pathetic picture in history than this religious fanatic, singing hymns to the god
whom the people .refused to worship.”— SUN cable.
TOURIST: “But why did he make a god of such an abominable object?”
GUIDE: “The people of his day believed that the god gave him the lyre, and that accounted for his devotion.”

was, in terms of the Constitution Act, removable
only by the Queen upon Address by both Houses.

whether a Judge of the Supreme Court could be
removed upon such a motion, which did not propose

A disgraceful display of ruffianism occurred on
Saturday at Homebush in connection with the
second Junior football match, Homebush v. Orient-
al. From tl)p start Oriental made the game very,
“willing,"" and the referee, Mr. H. Hazel, with a
commendable determination to enforce tha rules
regarding rough play, ordered two of the visiting
team off the field. This 1 action, coupled with the
subsequent defeat of the Oriental team by 12
po.nts to nil, so enraged the players_and their
supporters that they proceeded to “deal it ouf’
to the referee at the conclusion of the maicai,
kicking and striking him in the most brutal
nsr, and showering upon him mud and other misA
sues. In self-defence Mr. Hazel was compelled'
to draw a revolver, with which he had coma
armed.

Shifting & Scribbler.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Brumbietown was purely a pastoral town-
ship. All its interest centred in stock and
country. If you were in no way connected with
either you had to be contented with a back seat.
Ihe pert commercial-travellers grew subdued and
retiring when business brought them to Brumbie-
town, and even racing-men were only tolerated on
account of their connection with horseflesh. In
the two leading hotels, resident squatters and
station-managers ruled the roast, whilst their
myrmidons aped them in their absence. In the
two inferior pubs, the shearer, the stockman and
the boundary-rider were supreme, and their yarns
were listened to with the respect due to talent. It
need scarcely be said that Brumbietown possessed
all the usual and natural appendages of a bush
town. I here was, of course, the doctor, who was
such a. clever man when he wasn’t drunk. There were
at least three storekeepers, who combined to live
and let live by keeping prices up ; and there was a
lawyer who was as gifted as the doctor—“ only
for the drink. ” Add to these the usual Govern-
Bient officials, saddler, blacksmith, carriers’ wives,
&c., and you have the population There was no
police-magistrate and no newspaper-man, and,
strange to say, both these long-felt wants were
supplied at the beginning of our story; in fact
but for the combined advent of the two there
would be no story to tell.
* # *
At about the same time that the Govern-
ment came to the conclusion that two Justices
of the -Peace were insufficient for the wants
of the growing population about Brumbietown, an
aspiring compositor who had made a small
rise discovered that a certain fortune lay in
the future support to be accorded to the Brcm-
bietown Star and Wattleshire Advertiser.
Lobbs coach then, on a certain day, dumped
down at Brumbietown the P.M., a hot-tem-
pered old fossil named Lisle, who was always
kept in hand for outside places where he
could do very little harm, and the spirit of the
x ress, in the person of Mr. J, Forman.
Lisle was, and always had been, one of those
uo-account men who pass the whole of their exist-
ence in more or less temporary Government bil-
lets—inevitably “ putting their feet into it ” when
possible ; kept in small positions by some un-
fathomable influence, and, of course, rumoured to
be of good family. Unfortunately, for him his
unknown influence was only good with one party,
and when their opponents were in power he felt
the bitter blast of obscurity. At present his
friends were up in the saddle, and Brumbietown
being in want of aP.M., he had been sent there
to get rid of him. Forman was a steady fellow,
with good business instincts and a knowledge of
ms trade ; he had some misgivings about his
literary ability, but trusted to common-sense and
good luck to pull through.
Whether the advent of that mighty lever, the
Press, was the baneful cause of it or not, from the
date of the first issue of the Star, there were two
hostile camps in the forraerly-.united little com-
munity. Lisle had snubbed “ the infernal news-
paper-man” on his way up, so they were not
cousins. ’ The lawyer really did know some
law when he was sober, while the P.M. didn’t
know a scrap either drunk or sober, so those two
fell out. IS aturally, sides were at once taken, and
before the third number of the Stab had well seen
the light, open war was declared. Whilst this
was the unsatisfactory state of things in the town,
the surrounding country was agitated by the news
that a feud of great bitterness had broken out
between two of the principal stations, so that the
demon of discord had apparently taken possession
of the whole district.
At this time there appeared in the town a
dilapidated traveller, in the state popularly known
as stone-broke. Amongst many other shifts and
dodges he could “pick up stamps’’and write a
little, and to his own intense astonishment found
himself at once installed not on the staff—but as
the staff of the Brumbietown Star, Celebrating
his instalment by one wild, joyous burst of revelry
by night and day, he then buckled to, and under
the watchful eye of Forman promised to develope
into a perfect treasure. His name was Robinson,
he was a young man, and had evidently been well
educated. Into the police-magistrate feud he
ffung himself with an ardour that made Forman
tremble, but, assisted by the lawyer, who for a time
kept preternaturally sober, they safely weathered
the libel law, and made Lisle and the opposition
pastoralist faction gnash their teeth with rage.
Ihe most cherished traditions of Brumbietown
were set at naught. The “ pestilent rag ” agitated
for more commonage to be declared, then for more
areas to be thrown open for selection. It caused
a rush of selectors by its articles on the suitability
of the surrounding land for dairy-farms ; and the
staff sent long letters to the metropolitan papers,
which, although cut down to a “stick,” were
headed‘‘Brumbietown,”and served to advertise
the district as suitable for selection.
It was evident that this sort of thing would have
to be put a stop to or the town and the surround-
ing country would go to the devil. It was pro-
posed to establish an opposition paper, but as that
would evidently prove a loss, the idea was dis-
missed. Then, aided and abetted by the P.M.,
whose blunders and favouritism had been ruth-
lessly exposed in the Star, the leader of the
squatting party, who had suffered severely from
the selecting rush, laid a deep scheme to annihilate
‘the staff.” Robinson, who, under the excitement
of battle, and out of gratitude to his new friend
Forman, had kept wonderfully straight, was fond
of a good horse. He had made friends with the
manager of a station about ten miles from the
town, who was one of the parties to the feud
before spoken of, and from Saturday to Mon-
day he usually stayed with the manager.
One Monday forenoon the staff was touch-
ing up a leader which he had thought
out on his way back in the early morning,
and which he calculated would make the other
side go and hang themselves with their own belts,
when he was astonished by the entry of the local
policeman who arrested him on a charge of horse-
stealing. Seeing that the affair was regular enough,
however astounding, the Staff had nothing to do
but submit, and proceeded with his captor to the
police court. The Bench was sitting—all, strange
to say, with the exception of one, being opposition
• ’ s-R The Staff was charged With taking and using.
U T tent to sfcea l> a ff 1- ey horse the property
of W. J. Seacombe, of Willy Nilly station. The
accused denied it ; the horse was one he had
ridden in from his friend’s station. At least, he
said so on seeing it, but although it certainly
appeared to be the same horse, it had the Willy
IS illy bx-and on it. He had come in early and left
the horse as usual at the stable of the Post-office
Hotel, to be taken back by one of the station
hands, according to the ostler’s evidence, and what
inferaalwitohcmfti had been and changed it into a
Willy Nxlly horse ?
By this time the lawyer had arrived, and was
defying the bench to proceed with the case; prov-
ing to them that they could have summoned his
client for illegally using, but that issuing a
warrant for horse-stealing was illegal, and that
they wouJd have to pay heavy damages— to all of
which the Bench turned a deaf ear. Seacombe’s
overseer swore to the horse, so did the ostler.
■Robinson himself admitted that he had ridden a
grey horse over, but at the moment he had no
evidence to offer in defence. The Bench had an
earnest discussion, then the friendly J.P. and one
of the opposition left the Court, evidently differing
from the conclusion arrived at by the others. Old
Lisle, as chairman, to the blank astonishment of
everybody, committed the prisoner for trial on a
charge of horse-stealing, bail being refused.
The lawyer retired foaming to the nearest pub.,
where he held forth for two hours on the unalien-
able rights of British subjects and the glorious
palladium of British law.
Borman and one of the leading storekeepers dis-
patched a joint telegram to the member for the
district calling on him to raise Cain, the prose-
cuting party retired to lunch, and the Staff was
locked up. The scheme was a fairly good one ;
even though the Staff could not be convicted of
horse-stealing at his trial, ho would have to wait
in prison for it, and as there was no convenience
for keeping prisoners in the local lock-up, he wou’d
bo dispatched to the nearest town. Then they
would have Forman alone and crush him.
That night, unfortunately for the plan, old Lisle
drank champagne and talked. He asserted several
times to residents in the town that he would shift
the blank-blank scribbler if he lost his billet for it.
His friends got him to bed, but what he said was
remembered. The manager of the station where
Robinson had stopped could not remember seeing
him actually start, but he swore that to the best
of his belief ho rode a grey horse belonging to the
station identical in appearance with the Willy
Nilly horse, but, of course, with a different brand.
The member eagerly commenced to raise a very
■storm in head-quarters, and altogether the oppo i-
tion felt they had gone too far. Instructions were
received from the department to release Robinson
on bail, and the lawyer took a shower-bath every
half-hour to sober himself up.
Old Lisle sat on the bench with bloodshot eyes,
glaring at the accused when he appeared with his
two friends to sign the bail-bonds.
*’ Stop a minute ! : ’ said Robinson, “ I must sign
in my own name. Everyone knows that Robinson
is not my name—it’s Lisle, the same as that man
who has just tried to make a convict of me. I
have the misfortune to be his sou.’’
“You villain! you liar!” gasped the old man.
“My son ran away long ago and died.”
“ He ran away at fourteen : ran away from your
cruelty, and has been knocking about the work!
ever since ; but he’s not dead, for he’s here.”- The
young man unbuttoned his wristband and bared
his wrist, showing a white scar almost encircling
it. “Look here,”- he went on, amidst an awed
silence,_ “Do you remember, just a year after my
mother’s death, tying me up with a piece of
fencing-wire, to give me a flogging, while I
struggled so that I cut my wrist to the bone ?
There’s the mark, you affectionate father.”
The old man sa'd nothing. Everyone who
looked at him could see the truth of what they
had heard in his face. He gasped for breath, and
the doctor, who was in court, ran to him. “ He’s
got a fit,” he said, as they carried him out, and it
was one he never rallied from, for he died without
recovering consciousness next morning.
The affair was hushed up, for although Forman
fought hard to induce young Lisle to prosecute for
conspiracy, he refused. The explanation was
simple enough : noticing the similarity of the two
horses, the Willy-Nilly overseer paid a tracker to
ndein immediately after Lisle, change horses un-
observed in the stable-yard, and ride back on
Lisle’s mount. Information was then at once
laid and the arrest followed.

Dear Bulletin, —Many years ago. whilst
digging on the N.Z. West Coast, 1 chanted to be
mates with a litt’e red-headed Irishman, nick-
named ‘‘The Quaker” from his habit of “ theej
ing and “ thouing.” For instance, he would sa'
“ Friend, wilt thou obleegc me wid a loight.” II
had been some time in Philadelphia, and had
there acquired the habit. Well, the “ bhoys
tyere going to have a big night. The Hibernia’. 1 ,
Society were holding a banquet, and “The Quaker
was in a terrible state, for not having joined the
society he was debarred from attending. “Be
gob, friend, ’ said he to me, “if I only had a
green sash I d try me luck.” “ How ""do you
mean ?’ said I. “ Why, if I marched up to the
dhure, bquld-loike, wid a green sash on, mtbbe
they d iiivcr ask me if I was a mimber or not.”
1 suddenly remembered that I bad a Forester's
sasli in my box, and the thought struck me to
play a joke on "" The Quaker."" So, going to tin-
box, I produced the sash arid asked “ how will this
do?’ “Friend,” said lie, “thou hast a sash,’
looking at it admiringly, “ Yes, and if it's any
use to you you can wear it,” I replied—At the
saiue time placing it round his neck. It was of
bright green, and his eyes lighted up with pride.
“But, friend,” he said, catching sight of the gold
letters, A.U.F., upon it, “ what do these mean?”
I his was a poser, and I paused a moment to con-
sider ere replying. But a happy thought came,
and drawing him close to me 1 said mysteriously,
“ Don't you know?” “Xay, friend.” “Whisper,”
said I ‘‘ Amerienn- Order of Fenians.'' He drew
back-, looked hard at me, and then silently grasped
my hand. He knew I had been in America and
never doubted for a moment that I was one of
the Order. He went off to the banquet in high
spirits, and I followed at a distance. At the door
he was stopped, but drawing one of the members
aside a wlr'spered conversation took place, “The
Quaker” frequently tapping the sash with his
hands, and to my surprise, he was allowed to walk
boldly into the hall. He told me next day that he
was the hero of the night, and to this day he be-
lieves in the American “Order- of Fenians.” and
that I am one of them.— Buster.

This interesting creature has a way some-
what less in size than a florin in the lar-

tured in with unmistakable fidelity, is the
face of a Mongolian, a diabolical, leering
Jap., With eyfes, nose, mouth, high cheek
bones, and wrinkled forehead, fully and
clearly defined. Nowhere in the uncon-

finished a picture of the human face as

The Rev. L. M. Isitt, a Maoriland temper-
ance captain, who in recent vigorous campaigna
has earned the titular distinction of The Apostle
of Prohibition,” is in Sydney on his way to the
General Wesleyan Conference about to he held at
Adelaide . . . and in conversation with a
Daily Telegraph reporter, he laid out the history
of the Maoriland temperance movement on a
rapid sketch plan scale -
“ Then you are evidently looking forward to a
big political temperance fight in Maoriland .
“Yes ; at the first opportunity.”
“ Did the women’s vote assist temperance
“Immensely,” Mr. Isitt said, “and from his
own point of view, Mr. Seddon never made a
bigger blunder than when he allowed female
franchise to become law, for sooner or later
women’s influence, it is generally agreed, will give
the prohibition party absolute victory.

CULTURE IN AUSTRALIA.
""Asked by the Press Association in New York whether the treatment of the theme of his new novel was likely to involve him in difficulties with the Australian
Customs authorities, in a similar way to 'Redheap,' Mr. Norman Lindsay replied: 'I consciously da nothing to merit censorship, but it would be impossible for me
to write a textbook on arithmetic without having the censor ban it.'""_Cable.

General Debilitation,
A CASE IN PYRMONT.
A Permanent Recuperation.
The Case of Mr. W. H. ATKINS.
(BY our reporter.)
VVhat an easy matter it is for a benevo-
lent being to diffuse pleasure and gladness
around him. In order to do so it is only
necessary to consider what means are pos-
sessed to lighten the burdens of our fellow-
men and to help in whatever direction the
may dictate. It is evid-nt that
William Henry Atkins, of No. 211
Crown-road, Pjrmont, shares in this
opinion, for he said in reply to a question
put by our reporter : .
“Of course, I will give you any informa-
tion you require, as the knowledge I gained
may be turned to good account by some
poor sufferer in need of good advice. It
has always been my motto to-help those in
distress, and I think 1 can do so by letting
humanity know about the remarkable ex-
perience I bad. I think that worry was at
the back of all my troubles, for after an in-
cident which pi ieved me greatly, I fell into
bad health. I did n- t care about anything
ts eat, siinp’y because I had no appetite.
The most tasty morsels imaginable failed to
tempt me as a rule, although I had to force
myself to take some nourishment when I
felt that I could not hold out any longer.
Not only was my appetite bad, but I ab-
stained from eating because of the pains
which afterwards appeared. My stomach
always got full of wind, which shifted about
from side lo side, and left cramping gains
in all directions, and heavy pains affected
my chest. Sometimes I felt as if the
breath was bring crushed out of me, the
oppression was s > efreat, and I naturally felt
deeply concerned about it, as chest com-
plaints are so r'mis in their consequences.
As my food was not doing me any good I
lost strergth lapidly, and soon I dropped
into that languid state of indifference to
even thing which is so disastrous to every
business man’s career. I felt as if I did
not care how things went., and the morbid-
ness of my spirits quite precluded me from
thinking about anything pleasant. Haras-
sed as I was by depressing headaches, and
with my eyes dim and feeling as if they
were swollen, no wonder that I lost all in-
terest in life, for the average man does not
wish to live unless he is contented and at
ease.”
“But your lot was not so hard to bear
when night came, for then, I suppose, you
obtained relief in sleep ? ” remarked Mr.
Atkins’ interrogator.
“ Don’t you believe it; if anything, my
nights were more intolerable than the days,
as I could not succeed in getting anything
like a night’s rest. Certainly, I used to
doze off from time to time, but the sleep
was not refreshing, because of the intrusion
of repulsive dreams, and when I got up I
felt as weary as if I had l een awake all
night. I could hardly stand the bitter taste
which was in my mouth every morning, and
the unhealthy condition of my stomach
could be detected by the fur on my tongue;
hut what I regretted more than all else was
the quick and painful throbbing of my heart.
When I laid down I felt that organ shaking
inside in a way that caused me much alarm,
so that, with every particle of strength
being gradually eaten away by my com-
plaints, there was nothing in my condition
to assist me in entertaining hopes of a re-
covery. The least exertion brought on a
feeling of faintness, and when 1 stood up I
used to get quite giddy, as if everything
was on the move. All this I put down to
my extreme weakness, which was also re-
sponsible for the annoying aches in my legs
and loins From some cause or other my
arms were also intensely painful, and if ever
a nervo""? system was wrecked it was mine
On the least provocation I became excited
and irritable, while the trembling of my
nerves served to increase the general misery
of my existence. My body was greatly de-
nuded of flesh, and I can tell you in all
seriousness that my life was a burden which
I would willingly have cast off at any
moment.”
‘ I bel eve you suffered in this way
several years,” interjected the scribe.
“ During the period of your illness did you
ever enlist the services of a medical man ’ ”
“ Considering that I was lingering, wait-
ing, and hoping for years, I should ra'her
think I did,” replied Mr. Atkins. “ Why,
I consulted dozens of doctors, yet my suffer-
ings grew worse, and I may also state that
I have taken scores of medicines which were
procured at stores and chemists’ shops. It
would have been far better if I had kept
the money in my pocket, for all but one of the
medicines were of no service to me. The
only remedy which suited my complaints
was Clements Tonic, and this was recom-
mended to me by a man living in Harris-
street, who had used it, and knew what it
could do. After taking two bottles of
Clements Tonic I felt much better, and was
able to get about with much more freedom.
I went to a chemist to get some more, but
he put ine off by saying he could give me
something better, and pointed out ilia
difference in the size of the bottles, so,
foolishly enough, I bought his medicine in-
stead of Clements Tonic, and in a few days
I was as bad as ever. Then I insisted on
having Clements Tonic, and again I im-
proved under its influence, so that there was
no doubt about its being the best medicine
in the market. I would rather have one
dose of Clements Tonic than a barrelful of
any other medicine, for it proved its supe-
riority in every possible way. The first
thing it did was to make me eat and sleep,
and I was glad of the respite from my
afflictions which I had when resting. Be-
fore long a feeling of animation spread right
through my system, and I then shook off
the yoke of depression which had clouded
my past few years, as I felt assured that
Clements Tonic would pull me through. In
course of time the pains arising from indi-
gestion were quelled; the nauseous taste
left my mouth, and my head was free from
aches. Some of my doctors raid my liver
was diseased, while others said my stomach
was extremely weak; but if they had seen
me after a few weeks’ use of Clements
Tonic they would not have known me. My
stomach could then digest and retain any
kind of food, and my liver symptoms were
non-existent. The shaking of my nerves
was promptly checked by Clements Tonic,
and the regulating and strengthening effects
of that medicine on my system generally
were really extraordinary. Every ache and
pain yielded to the pacifying influences of
Clements Tonic, and I am heartily thank-
ful to say that by its exclusive use my
health w’as re-established. I have lived in
this house for the past 17 years, and all the
neighbours know that Clements Tonic cured
me ; but for the benefit of those who are
unaware of these facts you may publieh
them in any form you like-”

Albury, Sunday.—The ex-
cursion of the Federal Par-
liamentary party for the
purpose of inspecting the
Tooma site was fraught
With a good deal of un-
certainty. Only one motor-
car (the property of a local
owner) succeeded In reach-

r Premier Wade has
informed his party
that at the coming
conference of State
Premiers he intends to
stand by the big grain-
sack, and declares his inten-
tion of defying the Australian
Government to make it any less.
The Bulletin suggests that when the
State Premiers meet, they should hold
a competition to see how big a bag of
wheat each Premier can carry up a
plank.

PEACE ON EARTH, GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN.
(A Christmas Carol by the Nations.)
The orchestra of Christmas-tide appears
But once in each recurring year of life.
It plays a tune, at best, of doubts and fears
Concerning bills, and the eternal strife
Of creditors and their dejected prey.
All the performers virtuously talk
Of Charity — they're doing it to-day
Wherever Wealth and Pauperism walk.
N.s.w.
As in the past we sing of Love and Peace
While Jap and Chow hiss words of litter hate;
While Turks slit Christian throats in ancient Greece;
And Ireland strafes the stranger in its gate.
* * * *
This should have been the gayest Christmas Day
The harassed human race has ever seen :
In point of fact, it is in every way
The same old Festival it’s always been.

UNCLEAN LEGISLATORS.
“ When commenting recently upon the position in which the O’Shea
disclosures placed Mr. Parnell we expressed satisfaction at the giowth
of a public opinion which refused to accept public sen ices, however
eminent, in eondoneraent of criminal personal conduct. . . . And
public opinion is perfectly right. .... The public verdict in the
cases of Dilke and Parnell emphatically assorts that morality must in
future be as essential to public life as ability, and that the absence of
the one cannot be compensated for by the presence of the other. Ihe
strong public sentiment which in England lately has been pronouncing
inexorable ostracism against transgressors ,of tie moral code is based
on an increased understanding of .ethical morality,. The feeling which
underlies it is not only abhorrence of criminality per se, but a right
apprehension of the fact that one who is guilty of private transgression
cannot be trusted with the conscientious discharge of public duties.
. . , . It is a pretty safe maxim that whoever will deal selfishly
and dishonestly with his fellow-men ?is individuals will do the tame
with them as a whole when the opportunity presents itself. To place
in positions of supreme trust as law-makers and custodians of public
finances men who cannot in .their own personal affairs present a clean
record is about the same as to choose bank-managers from among
known pickpockets The doors of Parliament should stand
firmly closed against the trickster whose career has led him to them
through a course of dishonest a,nd dubious actions . . . and to the
foul and lecherous creature whose domestic conduct is a blot and a dis-
grace upon the society which his presence pollutes. • • • • We are
not so short of men or of manhood in N.S. Wales as to be forced to
seek law-makers in the ranks of hypocritical . . . adulterers. The
people must insist more than they have yet done upon getting repre-
sentatives conduct is able to bear daylight upon it in every par-
ticular either in or out of Parliament. _ We want honest and trust-
worthy men to make our laws, not salacious reprobates .... or
unscrupulous scoundrels.” — Sydney Ministerial Organ, 2Gth Feb.,
1891.

THE NEW ECONOMIST.
“For six months or so Treasurer Joseph Cook has been telling Australia how he loves economy, and all the public servants shuddered to think of wrath and retrenchment.
The mountain labored and brought forth a mouse. Briefly, the estimated expenditure of the year is £64,604,458, as against last year’s. £64,624,087. In all those millions the
economy amounts to £19,629. There will be no added taxation. The accumulated surplus, however, will be eaten into to the extent of £2,817,108. Eighteen months more of such
economy, and the whole of the surplus will have disappeared.”— SUN.
MISS AUSTRALIA: “You haven’t given my horse much chance. I thought you were going to make it easier for him in his next race.”

There were lessons which their present experience tanght and which he trusted would be taken to heart by the Government and by the people. This vice of gambling had
spread like some dread epidemic throughout the length and land, and he would rejoice to see some crusade started winch would have the effect of checking its
growth and finally rooting it out altogether.""

AT CHRISTMAS
BY V.J.D.
WTHE DREAMER.
ITHIN the Austral Christmas-tide,
Whenas his very heart of heat
The sun poured down, from skies
above,
Upon this South Land of his love,
And low warm winds with languid
feet
Went faintly up and down, and died
There was a dreamer, dreamy-eyed,
Who sate beside the sea and read
That book of song, so passing sweet,
The Poet of the Red Rose writ;
So all men marvel, reading it,
That song can live and Chaucer dead.
And even as he paused and sighed—
For alf the perished goodlihead
Of those green years of old, deep sleep'
Fell on him, and so, dreaming-wise,
He saw the ghosts of days arise
That long ago were drowned deep
Down in Lethean waters dead.
Of old time, tales by gray, fjddssung
and said,
Thus was his strange dream formed an 3
fashionM.
THE DREAM.
A King «*.te on a throne of wrought-red gold
tri h groat room whose four fair walls were hung
V Ith rarest hangings, drooping fold on fold
From roof to rush-strewn floor, where shield?
were dung
In shining heaps, with helmets raven-winged,
And spears which many a King's head had un-
kinged.
A fierce fire blazed on the broad hearth, and
threw
Long 11. es of fitful flame on shield and sword,
And lit up now a maiden’s eyes of blue.
And nov the wild eyes of a warrior lord :
The wind without moaned like a soul astray
In the gray dusk of r,hat December day.
THE KING.
The King upraised the bowl to bearded mouth.
But, stopping suddenly, cried, “Lords, this wine.
Is like to b'ood of men we slew in South
Sun-lands, w - hen our sharp prows cut through
the brine
* Last Mead month. Take away the wassail-bowl,
And hear the thought that works within my soul I*
« “Fa r lords lam aweary of the wars,
Aweary of this heaping-un of s ain.
And spilth of blood for Odin’s sake and Thor’s, jj
The gods have both the glory and the gain ; j
Their temples gleam wPh gifts of gold our hands
Wrung from the feeble folk of far-off lands,
"" Wh le we, war-worn and gaunt, come home to
yearn £
Forever for the foam of the salt sea ; t
And our own little land and homesteads spurn |
st thought of the strange palaces that be
Beyond them. lam old and battle-scarred,
And serve no more the gods of Asagard.”
Kre ever the King’s words were fairly sped |
A voice cried from the du3k, ‘ The Gods are |
dead,' c
And o’er the threshold of the garth there stepped ;
A wonderful white maid whose tresses swept 9
In golden glory to her girdlest-ead. ""
And as through rings of mail-clad men she passed*
Great fear fell 01 them, and each eye shamefast N
Looked down, well-knowing that the end had a
come ... |
Of all the blood-stained days of Pagandom, |
Thvn spake she, wi.h m;ek glances throne ward!
cast,
THE MAIDEN.
"" Of Christ the crucified I bring
’The ridings unto thee, O King !
"" Well spa-ke the voice. ‘ Th» gods are dead,
Who nevor lived but i» the head
of scalds, whose songs set them on high.
To thunder fro* the upper sky !
“ There Is no Ooi but one. whose Soa
Was bom for your redemption
** This day ia distant Galilee
Grey years agon*. Before him flee
“ Unrest and Hate, as at the gleam
Of dawn departs a wild vraudream.
** His face is fairer than the snows, /
His woupds are redder thafi the rose.
"" He cometh over fell and fosse
Bearing the burden of a Cross.
“ Whereon sits the White Bird of Love,
No raven—-but a meek-eyed, dov e.
"" And hearing of thy sorrowing
And heavy-beartedness, .O, King,
"" I came through wastes, where winds are dumb,
To tell thee of His hithevoome l
“ So let this day, His birthday, be
A day of joy for thine and thee ;
"" And deck the hall with holly, then,
In sign of what He did for men.
“ Its thorns are for His thorn-crown’s rim,
Its berries for the blood of Him.
"" Let mistletoe he hung above,
For that He gave the kiss of love
“ To friend and foe alike, and fir
For palm of victory be there ; ,
“ And let the youths and maidens sing
A carol unto Christ, 0, King 1”
The music of her \ oice died out, ftnd 10.
She vanished ns a snow-flake, in the snow !
Whereat the king looked slowly up and said
“ The old goda are well done with, being dead,
Their hands were bloody , and the ways they trod
Were dark and deathful ; but this fair new god
Is white of hands, and pure and pitying,
And will not from our woes a worship wring
As did the old gods; so maids sing this tide
And lords drink deep to Christ the Crucified ! ”
Out on the floor ft the king’s words stood forth
Three grey-eypd singing maidens of the North,
Who sang this cafol of the Blessed Birth
And how d&tTs ®Cs oatue dum? to dwell tin earth.
THE CAROL.
“ Born in a little stead
Was the Lord Christ,
When the red leaves fell dead
Tn the fiords iced ;
Stars sang and moon of Him,
Scalds sing a rune of Him l
“ Wise men from far-off lands
Came there and bare
Frankincense in their hands,
Red gold and myrrh ;
Kings ki: ted the nhoon of Him
Scalds sing a rune of Him !
“ Thus was He born, and thus
Lowly lived Fie,
Dyiiig for sins of ns
On the cross-tree ;
Bitter the noon of Him.,
Scalds sing a rune of Him 1
“ He who this song of Him
Remembereth
Need not fear in the dim
Day after death.
Blessed the boon of Him,
Scalds sing a rune of Him ! ’’
The carol ceased : the hush so deep
That upon all men sate like sleep
With bitter words was broken through
By a grim-bearded Berserk, who
Knew nought of this new God, the king
Would give his lords for - womaning
Of all the warmen, “ Strike,” he said-,
""The battle-song of Thor instead,
That led us over fields of war
In days gone by. Sing, scald, of Thor 1”
The grey-haired scald struck the harp-strings
To sing the song of the sea-kings ;
But as he touched each wild war-key
The strings cried out In agony.
As if they knew no song could bring
Help to the old faiths tottering.
Then thrice he tried the song to raise
Of Odin and the olden days ;
But ever as the harp-strings rung
The sword-song died upon his tongue,
And softly as the falling snow
This song from his pale lips did flew.
, THE SCALD’S SONS.
*ir I Odin and Thor are dead ;
-A- 51 t-he old gods are dead,
V A _ iu their winding-sheets.

Never of As&gard

■ ■ Our times are avil-starred ;
Seeing this white Christ bears
Peace to His worshippers.
And that our songs are set
But to old battle -airs. '
THE DREAMER WAHLHTH.
The song of ancient times and folk
Still spake whenas the dreamer wok*,

NO ROOM FOR THE FUTURE CHILDREN OF AUSTRALIA.
Merivale, chairman of Sydney Chamber of Commerce, urges that because the infant nation of Australia hasn’t yet fully occupied the Northern
Territory it should be handed over to niggers. This picture represents Merivale’s own house. When he was newly married, and the children
hadn’t yet begun to arrive, he really only required about four rooms of his mansion. So, on his own principle, he doubtless invited Chinese and
Hindus to permanently occupy the rest of the premises. According to Merivale's theory it is foolish and unpatriotic to keen any space for
the children who are to come.

Candidate for Goshen Flat: “I’m very sorry, gentlemen, but I have already shouted long beers all round, and if I set ’em up again I should get six months without
the option ; but there is nothing in the Act to prevent you shouting for me.” (A general stampede , and soon after the Goshen Flat brass band outside suddenly left off playing.)

A MEMORY.
At a special meeting of the executive of the Freetrade and Land Values League it was unanimously decided that the secretary should write to all Federal candidates for New
South Wales, requesting an answer to the following questions:-
1. Are you in favor of reducing the cost of living by abolishing Customs and Excise taxes now imposed upon food, clothing, raw materials and tools of industry?
2. In e vent of the tariff being re-opened, will you vote consistently to enlarge the free list, and, if that fails, in any case tor the lowest proposed tax?
AUSTRALIA: “Now, where have I heard that squeaky little voice before!”

HIS ESKIMO HONOR.
Judge Ewing, of Tasmania, just back from holding an inquiry at Darwin, says the North is “the place of lost souls.” He adds that it is the hottest spot on
earth, and that (though it is none of his business) he must include some remarks about the White Australia question in Ins report
HIS HONOR (home again, and interviewed by HOBART ICEBERG): “It’s a terrible, terrible place. There isn’t a snowball or a glacier in the whole
country, and I found my snow-shoes quite useless. When I asked for whale-oil at the best hotel the savages had never even heard of it.
They’re a brownish people up there, not blue with the cold like us, and I don’t like the look of them.""

To the Electors of King Division.
The following is the unpublished and un-
delivered address of Premier George H.
Reid to the electors of King division,
Sydney. The Bulletin has been waiting
to hear Reid deliver it, but at last its
patience has given out, so it puts on an
eye-glass, and takes a large chew of toffee
these accessories are required to “ make-up”
the character, in the language of the stage—
and delivers the address itself:
To The Electors op King Division. —
Gentlemen : I appear before you for themanyth
time. In 1887, when this electorate was called
""I appear before you.”
East Sydney and had four members, you kindly
put me second on the poll (below Burdekin)
with 4108 votes—2262 votes ahead of the de-
feated candidate. By 1891 my popularity had
so far increased that I just got in as the last of
the four members, being badly licked by
M'Millan, Barton and Varney Parkes. I
got 2946 votes, and was just 686 ahead of the
defeated candidate. In 1894, when the King
was a single electorate, I got 819 votes, and
had a majority of 469. In 1895, I had 610
votes, and scraped in by a majority of only
132. I represent 610 out of 2174 electors.
This isn’t why I believe in majority-rule as
applied to Federation.
I have been a great success at dropping
things. In fact, I claim to be the champion
dropper of Australasia. Among other things
which I have first promised and then dropped
are the State Bank, State note issue, the

dustry, after swearing to
exterminate it), absen-
tee tax, graduated land
tax, the fiscal referen-
dum, and the raising of
loans locally. Which is
a good deal of drop-
ping to do in four years.
My only two conspicuously democratic
measures were the Navigation Bill and the
Shops and Factories Bill. The nominee Council
destroyed about all the good that was in both of
them. It also threw out my Stamp and Pro-
bate duties. Although you elected me in 1895

floor with the Council, that floor remains un-
wiped to this day. I have now announced (1)
that I am going to fight this election also on
the question of Council Reform, and (2) that I
have a great esteem for the unreformed Coun-
cil, and am going to carefully preserve the
nominee principle.
I promised at the late lamented Jubilee that
I wouldn’t go to England
or take a title. Naturally
I did both.
* • »
I am the author of the
famous £333,000 surplus of
1896. The published Govern-
ment Statistics show a defi-
cit of £448,000 that year,
but my surplus was quite
legal, for I passed a law
by which nearly £BOO,OOO
of the year’s expenditure
was not the year’s expendi-
ture at all. If I had passed
My Jubilee title.
a bigger law I could have made the surplus
.£3,000,000 instead of .£333,000.
The accumulated deficit is just about where
I found it. Also, I have just finished the
biggest year’s borrowing
since ’9l, and the big-
gest year’s loan expendi-
ture since ’93.
I was a bitter provin-
cialist till 1894, when it
became necessary to dish
Parkes. At that date
I turned Federationist,
and have remained so
ever since. Any one who
wants to see a real
Federationist is request-
ed to walk round me
twice and consider the
spectacle.

with New South Wales. Every invitation to
Federate has, so far, come from New South
Wales. That is why Jack Want and I always
throw mud at the other provinces and insinuate
Mud.
that it is they who are intensely anxious to
federate with us from the lowest and most
mercenary motives. This sort of thing keeps
the Federal spirit alive. Jack Want didn’t
call the other provinces “wolves.” I heard
him do it.
I agreed to the insertion of the 50,000 mini-
mum in the Enabling Bill, just to give Pro-
vincialism a good start. When it was proposed
to increase the minimum I suggested 80,000,
and said I would accept it, and voted partly
for it and partly against it. If I had wanted
to keep faith with the other provinces, and had
made it a Government question, and had told
my party to vote against the 80,000 minimum,
of course it would have been defeated ; but I
didn’t. lam an unusual kind of Premier, and
you never know what I am going to do.
When the Federal Bill was before the Council
my esteemed colleague, Jack Want, declared
that he was a provincialist, and the “arch-
destroying angel of Federation.” Also he de-
scribed Federation as “ a hydra-headed monster
basking in its constitu-
tionalbeastliness in this
bright and sunny land.”
I have taken Mr. Want
back into the Ministry
as a guarantee of our
joint sincerity in seek-
ing Federation. We
make a really beautiful
pair —we do indeed.
Hooray !
* * *
At the Federal Con-
vention I voted for the
three-fifths majority on
a joint sitting of the
two Houses (it was my
valued colleague, Car-
ruthers, who proposed
it), for equal represen-
tation of the States in
the Senate, and for leav-
ing the division of the
He had kept Jack Want's
wig in a soft place.
surplus to the Federal .
Parliament. I didn’t even call for a division
on the bounties question, or on the right of the
Senate to suggest amendments in money bills.
I voted against federating the debts and rail-
ways, and I didn’t once ask for a guarantee of
the territorial integrity of the States.
Now, I am against equal State representation
in the Senate, against the three-fifths majority,
the bounties arrangement, the power of the
Senate to suggest amendments in money bills,
and the leaving of the division of the surplus
to the Federal Parliament. Also, I demand a
guarantee of the territorial integrity of the
States, and I leant to federate the debts and
railways. In fact, I am against every im-
portant point that I supported, and I am howl-
ing for everything that I previously denounced.
Since writing the above I have begun to wobble
again, and I don’t really know whether I want
to federate the debts and the railways or not.
As I have beautifully expressed it, “ the last
word has not yet been spoken” with regard to
the financial arrangements. Therefore my
Federal amendment proposals are as clear as
mud. That is why I jeer at Barton for not
making his Federal programme more definite.
* • * *
When I came back from the Convention I
at once started to denounce the Bill because of
the things I had done my level best to put in
it, and because of its lack of the things I had
helped to keep out. I told the people to vote
against it. I voted for it my-
self. lam built that way.
I am a quaint and remark-
able person all round.
There were 72.000 votes for
the Bill and 66,000 against
it, but by reason of the 80,000
minimum, which I cordially
accepted and voted sometimes
for and sometimes against,
the minority wins. That is
why I am now hollering for
majority rule. When this
discrepancy is pointed out I
simply say that 7*,000 isn’t
a majority of the 295,000
electors. The 610 voters who

markable.
return me for King Division aren’t a majority
of the 2174 electors either, but that is quite
a different thing.
My friend and colleague, Jack Want, an-
nounced, before the Federal vote was taken,
that, if the Bill was carried, he would still do
his uttermost to block it in Parliament here
and also'in England. In fact, he was going to
damn the majority. He also
hollers for majority-rule now.
• * •
I am particularly strong
now in demanding that the
Referendum shall be inserted
in the Bill. When Wise pro-
posed the Referendum in the
Convention, I voted against
it. Wise is a beastly Aus-
tralian native.
When the Bill was lost,
The Attorney-
General’s gy-
rations.
on account of my 80,000
minimum, I, on behalf of the minority, and
in the name of majority-rule, asked Turner,
Braddon and Kingston to hold a Conference at
once, before the New South Wales general
election came off, to consider amendments.
Braddon refused, which conduct I have since
denounced as discourteous. I called Braddon
a lunatic, or something like that, at the Gon-
vention. That wasn’t discourteous. Besides,
he is a refined, frail, grey-headed old gentle-
man in bad health. Kingston also refused. I
didn’t call him any bad names in the Conven-
tion. He is a large, healthy, middle-aged per-
son who loves fighting, and he has a very short
temper. T i j
Turner agreed to the Conference I asked
for, but I took all manner of care that he
didn’t get it. He also asked what amendments
I wanted, but I refused to supply them.
Turner is a beastly lawyer. lam also a
lawyer.
By this arrangement I showed my sweet
reasonableness in asking for a Conference, and
the man who agreed to confer and the people
who didn’t agree to confer were equally left. I
have since denounced Turner for his lack of
sincerity. The fact that I promised to furnish
my list of proposed amendments was sufficient
reason for not doing it. And the fact that I
demanded the Conference before the general
election fully explains why the election is here
now and the Conference isn’t.
* * • *
When Barton was Attorney-General and
tried to put a Federation Bill through Parlia-
ment Want and I both opposed him. That is
why I now sling mud at Barton and accuse
him of making no attempt whatever to help on
Federation.
When Barton decided to contest Bourke he
showed himself a coward for running away
from Sydney. I challenged any of the Federal
leaders to meet me in King Division, and
Barton, much to my surprise and disgust,
accepted the challenge. That also shows that
I never expected YOU!
he is a coward—for running
away from Bourke. I don’t
want to fight big Barton.
I only wanted to fight little
Tom Slattery.
Barton wants to reform
the New South Wales
Council by making it an
elective paid body with no
property qualification and
based on manhood suffrage
—just like the proposed
Federal Senate. Thatproves
him to be a wretched Con-
servative. I propose to
keep it an unpaid House
of Nominees. That shows
that I am the only genuine
Liberal now on the market.
The other reasons why I am a Liberal are
that I voted against the Referendum at the
Convention, and against the rule of the
majority in the joint Federal House, and in
favor of giving Tasmania, with 170,000 people,
the same voice in the Senate as New South
Wales with 1,300,000. Also, I dropped the
State Bank and State note-issue and other
things for the same reason. Another proof of
my Liberalism is that I hold a 66,000 anti-
Federal minority should boss a 72,000 Federal
majority.
* * * *
With regard to purely New South Wales
politics, I promise Local Government and a few
other things, just as I did before, and mv pro-
mise is just as valuable as it was then. lam a
strong believer in the Referendum, which is the
reason why I broke my promise to have one on
the fiscal question. And lam the same reliable
Freetrader as of old, in consequence of which
I am going to protect the sugar duty and I
levy £1,300,000 per head in Customs duties —a
larger sum in proportion to population than is
levied in such Protectionist countries as France
or Germany, and nearly twice as much per
head as is levied in the United States.
I am the head of a just and GoD-fearing
Government. My Government is a whale for
justice. That is why we refuse Suffield a
hearing, despite the strongest doubts as to the
fairness of his conviction.
Lastly, I have assured you that if you re-elect
me you will find me the Same Old George. In
other words, the same old Shuffler ; the same
old No-Yes ; same old Janus and Facing-Both-
Ways; same old two-headed curiosity on a
Same old George!
fence. And, under these conditions, I present
you with my amended Federal programme
(which I haven’t submitted to the other pro-
vinces, lest they should reply that they aren’t
having any, and then I couldn’t very well go
to the country on it) ; also my choice assort-
ment of broken promises. My other six or
eight amended Federal programmes will be
out shortly. If you re-elect me I don’t
know exactly what I will do, for I never
have known ; I have merely wobbled on the
spur of the moment. But at least you will find
me a fearless administrator, just as I was when
I let the Council reject my Probate Duties Bill,
and destroy all the good points in my Navigation
Bill and Shops and Factories Bill, after which
I didn’t demolish the Council, but grovelled
to it, and promised to preserve its nominee
character intact. Therefore I look back on my
steadily-diminishing majority of past years, and
wobble before you with confidence. And my
confidence is just the same kind of thing as my
old promise to abolish the unemployed in 24
hours, and my fiscal Referendum, and the other
things,
Here endeth (for want of space—not want
of matter) the unissued manifesto which the
same old George Reid— always different—
didn’t present to the electors of King
Division.

WE PUBLISH EVIDENCE LIKE THIS,
The Case of Mr. A. LYES.
(for tub “standard.”)
The requirements of the Australian popu-
lace can only be arrived at by reference to
the statistics which are compiled at vaiious
periods, and as evidence is necessary for the
purpose of gauging popular opinion, it may
here be interesting to listen to Mr. Albert
Lyes, of No. 7 Frazer-street, Leichhardt
When living in the North Coast dis-
trict,” said Mr. Lyes, “ [ experienced a
vast amount of trouble with my liver and
kidneys, the consequence being that I was
put to a lot of inconvenience owing to the
acute pains across the small of my back.
As I had heavy work to do at the time, my
afflictions came as a great hardship, more so
if there was any lifting to be done, when my
back pains were intensified to a degree that
I could scarcely endure.”
Reporter: “ Were you much affected in
any other part? ”
Mr. Lyes : “ It would be quicker for me
to tell you where I was not affected, for I
had aches and pains all over tne. There
was a cold, painful sensation in the spine
which felt as if somebody had shot a ball of
ice along my back, and that horrible shoot-
ing pain extended right to my eyes, which
also gave me the impression of being
swollen. I was sluggish, drowsy, and had
no energy whatever, the only tiling I felt
fit for being to lie down—it did not matter
where. It is a serious matter for a married
man to get into that condition, but I held
out as long as I could, and then I had
to give in, for all the grit was taken out
of me. Being without any appetite, which
had been on the wane for a long time, the
chances of stopping a further leakage of my
vitality were very remote, and as I could not
sleep at all well at nights, there was no
doubt that I was in a very grave state. With
my tongue covered with a nasty substance
and a vile taste in my mouth, there is
nothing remarkable in the fact that I could
not enjoy any food, and in the natural
course of events I got a long way thinner
than I ought to have done. I was tor-
mented with very severe headaches which
made me feel so gloomy and wretched that
there seemed to be nothing in the world
worth living for, and with my weakness
daily increasing, my limbs ached so persis-
tently that I could nob even take a walk in
comfort. Pal pi ration of the heart and dizzi-
ness always followed any exertion, my
heart being particularly bad. It used to
make a thumping sound like the noise from
a horse’s hoof heard in the distance, and
many an anxious hour have I passed in
thinking what might be wrong with that
organ. Like most people who suffer like
this for the first time, I constdted a
doctor, who said that my liver and kidneys
were diseased. He wrote a prescription,
which I had made up, and said I would
have to keep as quiet as possible, and not
exert myself any more than was absolutely
necessary.”
Reporter: “How did you feel after
taking his medicine?”
Mr. Lyes: “Just about the same as
before, and when I saw it was only so much
waste to take any more I dropped it- olf.
The oppression in my chest and the flatu-
lence in my stomach were still there, and
the urine remained of a cloudy and scanty
nature, so what was the use of throwing
any more money away I thought ? Besides”
my nervous system was completely out of
order, as any kind of noise had a startling
effect which kept my nerves at extreme
tension, as if they had been suddenly un-
hinged, and then, again, I felt agitated and
irritable at the slightest provocation. The
long-continuance of these sufferings had
made me very morose and low-spirited, for
there were others to think of besides my-
self; but, thank goodness! that trying
ordeal is all over now, and it is not likely
to bo repeated, because I discovered a
remedy which cured my ailments then, and
i am sure it could do so again if ever I
needed it.”
Reporter: “ May I learn what the remedy
was ? ” J
Mi. Lyes : “I have no desire to keep the
matter secret, because I might do other
poor sufferers a good turn by letting you
know. It was Clements Tonic—a medicine
that I had been reading about—that made
a new man of me, and I always regard it as
my only friend amongst all medicines. I
had only taken a couple of bottles of
Clements lonic when I felt ever so much
better. In fact, the change was so great
that I could scarcely believe it myself
especially as I had lost confidence in
physics generally. But Clements Tonic
asserted itself as something uncommonly
good by rapidly giving me a desire for food,
and in the matter of making me sleep well
thought it a most marvellous medicine.
Ihe health-giving properties of Clements
-Lome were not confined to those improve-
ments, a 3 it amended the defects in my
internal organs which had gone against the
digestion of my food, and by those means
the pains in my chest and shoulders were
relieved. The fermentation of my food
was done away with in like manner, so that
I was getting the full benefit of my meals,
and how well I knew it ! for the return of
my strength was quite noticeable. I no
longer desired to lie about in a state of
careless languor, for Clements Tonic gave
me the energy and ambition to do some
work, which was becoming easier to per-
form each day, because the pains in my
back were less troublesome as time moved
on. My heart gave me no occasion to
worry myself, as it was beating with a
tegular pulsation, and with the departure
of my headaches my sight became so clear
that I could sit down and read for hours
without the least inconvenience. I was
greatly pleased with Clements Tonic for
the effect it had on my nervous system,
lor it invigorated my nerves so thoroughly
that they became perfectly steady, while
such a thing as becoming excited or annoyed
over trifling incidents did not happen. A
good indication to go by as to the efficacy of
Clements lonic was the entire removal of
my deranged kidney symptoms, and it was
then that I was altogether free from pain.”
Reporter : “ Did you stop taking your
medicine immediately that happened ? ”
Mr. Lyes: “Not exactly, for I wanted
to be quite sure that all disease was effaced,
so I took another couple of bottles of
Clements lonic, and when they were
finished it was not necessary to take any
moie, as I was as strong and thoroughly
restoied as I could wish to be. It is several
years ago since ( lements Tonic put an end
to my sufferings, yet my work has never
since interfered with my health—a fact
which shows that Clements Tonic made me
as sound as a bell ; and if these statements
are likely to i e perused by others, you may
publish them as you like.”

MR. WINKLE’S SUDDEN ATTACK OF COURAGE.
Whether Mr. Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of insanity which originates in a sense, of injury, or animated by this display of Mr. Weller’s valor, is uncertain; but certain
it is that he made a terrific onslaught upon a small boy who stood next to him ; whereupon Mr. Snodgrass announced in a very loud tone that he was going, to begin .—Pickwick Papers.
After having allowed the coal strike to last for five weeks, Premier Wade celebrated his return to his office by belaboring Mr. McGowen
“for doing nothing” in connection with the matter.

THE LOGIC OF BRITISH CAPITAL.
“The leading Westralian mining co.’s contemplate making a big reduction in wages. In a speech made by Lord Castledown at a meeting of the West Australian Goldfields, Limited, last month,
here is another straw which shows how the wind is blowing. He said: ‘ The labor, so difficult a problem in Africa, one which has been the real cause of all the bloody fights now going on in
Mashonaland, will undoubtedly be solved in West Australia on different and more satisfactory lines. It may be that the white man will remain the sole factor in the labor question there, or it is
possible that some of the large laboring races may be imported from neighboring shores to work under the superintendence of the colonists.”— DAILY PAPER.
J, BULL: “My troubles about ‘ Australia for the Australians !’ Wot I says is, ‘ Australia for dividends on British capital.' Nigger labor means big dividends. If you weren’t
born a nigger — well, is that the fault of British capital, hey?""

PUTTING THIS AND THAT
TOGETHER.
These two items, from a Sydney morning
paper, read rather funnily
The Wesleyan Conference yesterday passed
a resolution urging all Methodist people to
observe the Sabbath, and to abstain from un-
necessary travelling on that day.”
It has been noticed during the last few weeks
that the majority of thefts from dwellings which
have been reported to the police have been perpe-
trated on Sundays. The thieves appear to have
taken advantage of the attendance of the occu-
pants of the houses visited at church to commit
their depredations.”

“Yes, yer uncle was hanged, an’ yer husband drinks, an’ I wouldn’t let my children be seen with their stockings like your brats.”
“Oh, wouldn’t yer? And if you’d wash yer face a little oftener perhaps people ’d find it easier to forget that yer folk used to be convicts.

EMULSION
OF
Pure God Liver Oil With Hypophosphites.
REASONS
B WHY CLEMENT’S EMULSION SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED
■ ""CAUSE it is an Emulsion, a simple mechanical mixture, and not a chemical combination.
Bs CAUSE it is easily digested and assimilated, the Emulsion does not change on contact with the
stomach fluids. _____
B ®CAUSE the patient derives the full therapeutical benefit from the entire dose of oil, as the Emul-
sion does not change until digested, every particle of oil being thus assimilated.
B fiCAUjSK of its pleasant taste, the presence of Cod Liver Oil cannot be detected by the most
fastidious, palate.
Bj SCAXJBE of the large per centage of Cod Liver Oil it contains, one-half of its bulk being pure Nor-
w ®Bian Cod Liver Oil.
""'CAUSE of its known composition, the formula being supplied to any registered practitioner on
Application.
B ®CAUSE it is prepared in the colony, which prevents any deterioration such as these delicate pre-
nations are liable to during a passage through the tropics, &o.
WHY OTHER (so-called) EMULSIONS SHOULD NOT BE PRESCRIBED
they are not Emulsions, but soaps, the oil being saponified, has lost most of its>irtues.
BECAUSE they are decomposed on contact with the acids of gastric j aloe, on acoount of the neu-
tralisation of the alkali used in their preparation,
BECAUSE, when the Emulsion (?) is decomposed the oil is indigestible by delicate stomachs, as in the
dyspepsia of phthesis, &c., when the oil is voided unchanged with the f meal matter without* be-
ing assimilated, consequently the patient derives no benefit.
BECAUSE most of them are rancid on being opened, the nauseous taste of the oil is very imperfectly
disguised, causirg unpleasant eructations for hours after a dose has been taken.
BECAUSE many do not contain more than 35 per cent, of oil, some not more than 25 per cent.
BECAUSE their composition is a secret, leaving the medical man in the dark when prescribing,
BECAUSE many are foreign preparations, are made in cold climates, are stale, and have mostly been
so long made that they have lost any valuable properties they may onoe have possessed.

«In. view of the importance to the fishing industry in New South Wales that the successful introduction of
tha electric-light fish-trap would mean, a party was organised by the Fishery Commission to test the capabilities of a
Locally invented one. They left Sydney on Friday night by the Government steamer Thetis, and proceeded to Jer-
vis Bay, where,)the experiments were made. Among those who made the trip were Mr: J. H. Want, M.L.C., and
Mr. W. R. Qampbell, M.L.C. (commissioners), Mr. Shekle-
ton (the inventor of the trap), My. Thomson (electrician),
and a party from the Museum in search of specimens.
The first trial was a failure. However, nets and
lines were brought into request, and about three
or four hundred fish secured.” —Ungrammatical

REFUSE SHOT HERE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“'When asked if there was not a danger in sending the Kaiser to Holland, Count von Bernstorff replied: ‘Where in hell were we to send him?’”
Now where in hell could this person go?
All gates were shut that we used to know;
He had barred them with weeping and blood and
woe.
The valiant Swiss, on their mountains high,
Looked out with a cold, unkindly eye;
They had suffered much and they well knew why.
The Danes, in the midst of the world’s alarms,
Stood to their guarded posts in arms;
They knew the Prussian in all his charms.
Across the Russian frontier red,
Where his own loud mouth had the tumult bred,
A king must travel without his head.
The gates were barred, not a door was seen;
The sea was not what the sea had been,
Tor mutiny stirred on the submarine.
So they tossed him over the low Dutch wall—
I rayer, bravado and crown and all —
To wait till the dirt-box man should call.

SQUARING THE CIRCLE.
George Reid, in a recent Victorian address:
He would warn Protectionists that they need not give any votes to him either in the House or out of it, for the moment he got the power he would make the tariff an honest tariff. He looked
upon protective duties as the downward path which led to poverty and corruption, and as long as he lived he would be squarely against them.
The news that George is going to be honest for the first time in his political existence, and that the man who protected such a wonderful lot of things
when he was a Freetrade Premier in N.S.W., is going to be Squarely against Protection at last, is indeed a staggerer. The physically globular Reid
and the politically crooked Reid are both familiar. The Square Reid would be the last straw. This country can’t stagger under three Reids.

AUNTIE DAILY PAPER: “You must keep on being a good boy, Willie, and always be kind to the nice fat gentleman, who. is really a poor
widow and a lone orphan. And when you do anything for him you mustn’t ask him to pay ; you must be a nice good boy and
ask him to lend you the money, and then you’ll be able to supply him with interest all your life. And he’ll be so glad that in time
he may adopt you for his own little boy.”

THE CABBAGE-TREE CAVE DWELLER.
The present loudest groan of the N.S.W. parochial gang is that tho Federal Parliament is to meet in Melbourne to choose the Federal city (in N.S.W.), and that it may
Federal city but simply go on meeting in Melbourne for ever, thereby making it the capital after all. This, like most of the other possibilities, is based on the assumption that all the peoples of
Australia, save only the pure and noble Cornstalk, are rogues and swindlers, which is rather interesting from the only province whoso Parliament delibetely broke faith over the Federal
compact.

OTTAWA. Friday Evening. The
American scientific expedition, under the
leadership of Dr. Stefanssen. which has
been exploring the Arctic regions of
Canada, reports the discovery of a new
race of people, who had never before
beheld a white man.— Cable.
The new race will probably live to
regret this—especially when the white
man’s various brands of rum and religion
follow as a matter of course
First “Bloke"" (readsi : “On Monday
the Treasurer expects to receive two
tons of halfpennies, the face value
of which will be £680.""
2nd ditto : “ Strike me pink, Snorky !
It looks as if the Guv’ment intended
to take over the two-up schools.”
The State Minister for Works
on Saturday announced his purr
chase, on behalf of the Govern-
ment, of the Kiama Road Metal
C'ompafiy ’s quarry, together with
a steamer, the whole cost being

The road metal will come in handy in

Speaker.
ELGIN (Illinois), Satur-
day.—During the pro-
gress of an automobile
contest here yesterday
the grandstand col-
lapsed.
The disaster caused a
panic, and the police and
military had to use their
clubs against the terri-
fied crowd which
streamed over the
course in front of the
racing cars.
Man in the Street (to policeman): “ Thare is not much
Choice between being ground to powder by
car and pounded to a jelly by a policeman’s club.
In the latter case, however, no action would lie i
so, prithee, stand aside.""

THE LIVERPOOL (N.S.W.) “TUBERCLE FARM.”—A MIDNIGHT DEPUTATION.
LEADER OF THE DEPUTATION : “As the most recent death at the institution, I have been asked, JOHN SEE, to introduce to you this deputation of the 1901 and 1902 victims of the N.S. W. Govern-
ment’s Liverpool Tubercle Farm. There are 76 of us killed in 1901, 55 so far in 1902, and we expect a couple more every hour. So we claim this to be a large and influential deputation.
What we wish to point out is that a consumptives hospital that would cure, not kill, would be really a permanent and reproductive work, and might, with much more advantage certainly
than your tombstone to soldiers, be charged to loan votes. The men who get consumption, and are cut off in the prime of life, are often men cf brains, often skilled mechanics Fat politicians
don’t get consumption; but I assure you that some men very useful to the State do. Save them, cure them instead of killing them, and you will have a valuable asset in the shape of an
increased body of taxpayers. It won t cost much—less than a ducal celebration. You will excuse the absence of the usual compliments: Dead men know not how to flatter John See—

Our'cricket barometer again.-
GOULBURN, Friday.—An inquest was held to-
day on an infant 7 months old, the son of a
laborer named Smith. The evidence showed, that
Smith had been in gaol for three months. He
came out yesterday, and went home drunk.
While he was in gaol his wife had been unable ;
to get sufficient money to keep the family, and i
had collected bottles and rags. She earned in !
this way from 4d to Is 6d a day. The child died ;
from marasmus, the result of insufficient food, i
“The holding^
capacity of a young infant’s stomach is
about one ounce. A lazy, careless nurse
gets a feeding bottle, with a tube, so that
she can lay the child down with the artifi-
cial teat in its mouth. She puls half a pint
of the milk preparation into the bottle, and
lets the baby suck away. This keeps it
quiet, but the result is that it overloads its
little stomach and vomits. So the milk is
blamed for being bad, when, if properly
used, it was quite good.” It is very pro-
bable that merely through ignorance many
children are done to death in this way to
save whose lives their mothers or nurses
would grudge no amount of care or trou-
ble.

Candidate No. 14 is not pleased with the
present Australian outlook. In a recent

terrible indifference to Divine authority.
There were evidences to his mind that there
was a spirit of Paganism creeping in amongst
us.”
“ Before the Primate's departure for Eng-
land he suggested that the parishioners should
make some special effort to mitigate the trials
of the clergy. The Easter offerings are
generally devoted to the clergy, and it is
further suggested that where naoney gifts are
impossible, gifts in kind should this year be
substituted.”
No reasonable offering refused !
“ Strange are the experiences of examiners.
Reporting on the examination of the Church
of England Sunday scholars in Victoria, the

MANY COMPLICATIONS LEFT BEHIND.
—wwr w——i— ——
All Banished and Health Restored
by CLEMENTS TONIC.
The Case of Mr J BARTLETT.
(BY A SYDNEY REPORTER.)
It is to the interest of this country that
all citizens should be so educated that they
may become a self-reliant and prosperous
people, and to put this idea into practical
effect a reporter was commissioned to bung
before the community a mat er here d< alt
with by Mr. James Baitlett, of No. 5
Patten’s Buildings, Kent-street, Sydney.
“In the time of a great epidemic,” said
Mr. Bartlett, “ when influenza was ram-
pant in Sydney, I was one of the many
who failed to elude that terrible disease.”
“ Were you in danger of meeting with
serious consequences? ” asked the w. iter.
“ There was every likelihood that I
would never get well again, as I was n a
frightfully low stato for many months.
Matters went so badly with me that I
thought I was fighting a hopeless fight
against an overwhelming force, and as I
1 was laid up for weeks, and could not do a
stroke of work for se\en months, I think I
had good cause to form that opinion. I got
so thin and ghastly white that, everynudy
thought I was going into consumption, be-
sides getting awfully weak into the bar-
gain. The pains in my head were enough
to run away with one’s senses, being of that
heavy, depressing nature which makes the
victim feel as if there is only care and
sorrow in the world, It was not the in-
fluenza itself that I had to regret so much
as the effects it left behind, for my system
seemed so upside down that there was not
a sound part about me. My limbs were so
racked with aches that if I walked a few
yards I had to sit down and rest for the
purpose of easing the pain, but another
reason why I could not go far wit.iout
taking a spell was because I used to turn
very giddy. Through that cause I nearly
fell down stairs several times, so
that I was almost afraid to move in case
of meeting with an accident. I wondered
what was the good of living in such misery,
for I had no energy, no pleasure, no any-
thing that was worth having. For weeks
and weeks I could not get any sleep, and
there was a feeling in my eyes as if they had
swelled up. A dark haze was visible at
every turn, my sight being so bad that I
could scarcely see. and if I wanted to get
anything for myself I had to grope about
aslf it were dark. I could not hear very
distinctly either, owing to a strange drum-
ming in my ears, so that I was not much
use to anybody. Indeed, I was a nuisance
to myself, and would like to have been out
of the way of the persecuting pains which
came to the small of my back and almost
paralysed me whenever I stooped. This,
together with the thickness of my urine,
told me that my kidneys were disordered,
and I was afierwards told so by the doctors
whom I was treated by, with the additional
information that my liver was also dis-
eased.”
“ Did they give you any medicine ? ”
“Of course they did, and I was never
behind hand in taking it, as my enforced
absence from work meant a great loss to
me, and I wanted to get belter. But, some-
how, my condition remained stationary.
When I examined my tongue it was al-
ways furred and rough, while my mouth
had a foul taste as if I had been drinking.
Not a morsel of food could I enjoy, but I
am not one to give in till I am fairly beaten,
and I used to make myself eat ; but it
would have been better if I had spared my-
self the trouble, as everything seemed to
decay in the stomach, and give rise to ex-
cessive torture in the form of windy spasms.
My chest also felt as if a pier-e of lead had
1-dged there for the purpose of stopping my
breath, and there was no relief to be got
till I vomited everything up again. The
weakness of my stomach was so advanced
that I could not keep my food down, so
that accounts for my feebleness and the loss
of flesh I sustained There was also some-
thing wrong with my heart, which palpi-
fated as if I had been indulging in some ex-
cessive exercise, and With my nerves all
gone I was completely wrecked from every
point of view. A twitching pain below my
neck irritated me, but for that matter I
was always in an irritable mood, even the
sound of voices raised in laughter being
sufficient to annoy mo; but I was so
des, erate and desp ndent that I did not
know what to do with myself. In any
short stretches of sleep I got there flashed
an awful picture upon my vision, and when
I woke up I could not help ""thinking that
something I dreaded would surely happen,
although I recognised that death would
have been preferable to any more suffer-
ing”
“ Why did you not try a change of
medicine ? ”
“If I had not done so I would not be
here to-day. as I w as sinking very fast after
the long and torturing captivity in the
hanls of my diseases, when a fellow work-
man prompted me to try ( foments Tonic.
It was not till I carried out his advice that
the influenza was beaten, and now, after a
long and convincing experience, I am sure
there is no medicine on earth tike Clements
Tonic, for after taking a eotipte of bottles I
was feeling a new interest in existence.
Trie improvement was then so marked that
I ventuted to hope that a possibility still
existed that I w’ould yet recover, and by
closely pursuing my latest course of treat-
ment my heartklt hopes were gratified. I
stated on the right track with a slight
appetite, which came through using
Clements Tonic, and which that medicine
continued to increase. Then my liver be-
gan to work more regularly, a fact which
afforded great relief in several ways. For
instance, my headaches slackened- off, and
the sickly taste left my mouth, besides hav-
ing full use of my eyes in consequence of the
disappearance of the haziness before them.
The pains in my bac and shoulders were
lighter than b fore, and I had no trouble in
breathing, as my chest was quite free from
oppression. A feefing of vigour crept
through my system through the medium of
Clements Tonic, and I was gaining in flesh
already, which showed that my food w'as
digesting well. I marvelled at the rapidity
with which my vomiting troubles were
stopped, while the action of Clements r l onic
on my nervous system could not be too
highly spoken of. When my liver and
kidneys had been relieved of all symptoms
of disease by Clements Tonic I hardly knew
how to suppress the gladness I felt, es-
pecially as no cause remained for a* xie y
as to the state of my heart, which ceased
palpitating shor ly after flatulence was
remedied.”
“ And now your health is perfect, I
believe 1 ”
“It could n n t be better, for I took
Clements Tonic till I was cured outright,
and for the past three years I hav e scaled
over 13 stone. lam thankful to be able to
give this information, which you can pub-
lish in any way it pleases you.”

THEN SAID THE KING UNTO HER: “What wilt thou, Queen Esther, and what is thy request? It shall be even given thee to the half of the
kingdom.”— Esther , chap. 5, verse 3.
And Queen Esther took King Ahasuerus at his word, and said she would have Australia, and as that country had no army or navy with
which to defend itself it became a Jap dependency, and remains so to this day.— Fragment of Australian Chronicle.

METALLIC MUMMIES.
A leading French physician, t)r. Variot, has been demonstrating the possibility of
obtaining metallic mummies of our friends, which may be used either for street decoration
or for household purposes. These onr monts can be prepared in gold, silver, nickel, or
copper, according to fancy and the pocke* and should the idea be adopted there is a great
future for this new branch of electro-plating. To effect the metallising much elaborate
apparatus is required, and the body has to bo previously painted with nitrate of silver to
render it a good electrical conductor. It is stated that .by regulating the deposit all details
of conformation may be retained, while at the same time the image can be made of
suffic’°nt thickness to withstand external blows.
A LONG-FELT WANT.

OATS IN THE SMOKING ROOM.
When the s.s. Orion left Devonport (Tas.) for wayside ports and Melbourne.the holds were crammed with cargo, and the men had to stand on the hatches to
force them down. There was cargo on the main deck and on the upper deck (and at Burnie, later on, 253 bags of chaff were also put on the upper deck).
There were 25 bags or oats in the smoking room. — Evidence given at inquest.
And the Orion went out and was never heard of again. Also, it seems that no one was responsible.

THE GOVERNOR AND* HIGH MASS.
“We are eon 3 of sturdy fathers, who wrung
the great charter from the craven John!'.’ declared
the mover of the resolution condemning the ap-
pearance of the Governor at High Mase in St.
Mary's Cathedral. And the five or six thousand
people In the hall cheered themselves 'hoarse.
Englishmen Question the acta of their Sovereign
or her representative slowly and reluctantly, but
when they do speak their words have greater
weight, contended the speaker. He denied that
the protest was an act of disloyalty, and as be
called attention to the battles of religious factions
fought by our fathers, when the faith of Protes-
tants —their faith —emerged triumphant, so thati
the Kings and Queens of England swore to defend
it at their Coronation, wave after wave of ap-
plause swept up from the thousands of people
below him, and his worde, “We are profoundly
and intensely loyal to her Majesty, and profoundly
and Intelligently respectful to any gentleman who
represents her, but we claim the right to protest
when he misrepresents his royal mistress and our
beloved and honored sovereign."" called forth the
enthusiastic approval of his hearers.
The meeting decided to send the resolution com-
plaining of the Governor’s action to Downing-
street.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE N.S.W. POLICEMAN.
(1) Plain cop; (2) cop with baton; (3) cop with revolver; (4) cop with rifle—a species now to be found at Broken Hill; (5—nearly due)
cop with complete armory; (6—coming) cop going on duty with artillery; (7) marine cop as he will be when the water policeman exchanges his
present craft for a small torpedo boat. No. 8, which was to be water cop with ironclad, was crowded out. But, considering all this development of
the cop, what is the exact value of that clause in the Constitution which reserves the right of maintaining military and naval forces to the Commonwealth?

A DOCTOR IN DISTRESS.
“Judge Cohen, chairman of the New States Commission, said it would be silly if they reported that the new State was a good thing because some people said it was a
good thing. What was the value of evidence if it did not tell them how the new State was to be financed?”
JUDGE COHEN: “I would order this one the same treatment as those other two hoys got; but if he grew up big and strong he would need more food and
clothes, and how do I know that he could buy them?”

BRITISH POLITICS IN BRIEF.
The British Empire covers about 11,500,000 square miles of the earth’s surface. The British Islands represent 121,391 square miles of that area, which
isn’t much. Out of the 121,391 square miles of the British Islands the spot which appears in white is the one which is making all the trouble by its opposition
to Irish Home Rule. In the north-west end of the white spot can be seen the walls of ’Derry, with the Rev. George Walker holding forth on the battlements
over 300 years ago. At the other end Carson’s loyal-rebel army is visible as it marches to-day, if it does march, which is doubtful.

THE PROJECTED DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA.
Periodically Sydney is troubled with a clamor and visitation of literature in its two morning
papers about the grievous wrong done to N.S.W. because its State Parliament isn’t allowed, quite
contrary to the Constitution, to select the capital of Australia, all on its own. One such literary
spasm has just petered out, and among all the dozens of letters written by crazy and parish-
minded loons who wore themselves to rags about the “ wrongs ” of the Ma State, it is a solemn fact
that not one letter and not one loon made an allusion to the interests of Australia. There was
not . a single suggestion, amid all the ravings of all the Huies and Johnsons and Gillieses
and the rest, that Australia had any claims to be considered in the selection of a capital, or in
any other wa,y. ihe “rights of N.S.W.” were talked off ad nauseam, and backed up with garbled
history and imaginary facts. The “claims ofLyndhurst” were discoursed upon at vast length;
liyndhurst isn t even mentioned in the Constitution as having any claims at all, but the hamlet
has made so much row that it almost begins to seem larger than the Northern Territory. The “in-
terests ot Sydney (also not mentioned in the Constitution) loomed large; and the “opinions of
Mr. .L in don Biddulpii ” were much heard of, though Biddulph didn’t even secure the job of
cleaner-up in the building where the Convention sat to draft the Australian Constitution. And
yet, ot the interests of Australia or the rights of Australia there wasn’t a word. Apparently
Australia is the one place of which the petty, squalid little group of Sydney Anti-
H ederahsts has never heard. These people know about Chili, and they have heard
ot dartory, and they can locate Timbuctoo, but their own country they do not know,
it would be a great and noble thing if some new Columbus were to arise from among
the Anti-h ederal push of Sydney, and fit out a caravel or a galley—these vessels
would be eminently suited to the antiquated turn of the Anti-Federal intelli-
?u nC A~)® a d forth an expedition to discover Australia, the one continent
the Anti-federalist and his friends haven’t heard of. Australia is a fair
country and worth discovering. The seeing of it would enlarge the mind
“ JOHNSON and give CARRUTHERSa wider outlook, and utterly flabbergast
the o.iVl. Herald and Telegraph, which would doubtless open
branch offices there when they had got over their surprise, and
Mart selling their papers to the inhabitants. Even Mr. Lin don
Biddulph, of Lyndburst, struggling, as a naturalist struggles
with a cockroach, to stick a pin through the bit of ground in his
own backyard which is the only possible site for a Federal
capital, might become a brighter and a better
Biddulph if he went away in that galley with the
other argonauts, and found Australia along with
them. There are thousands and millions of
square miles of Australia. It has possibilities which
may yet make it the greatest land on earth. It isn’t
all a backyard with an insect in it cursing
about his imaginary injuries. It is large enough
for great men, and great thoughts, and for a great
continental patriotism. And when the caravel
came back from finding Australia, and sailed up
the penny tram-line in Pitt-street, Sydney, and
cast anchor at the corner of King-street, it might
disgorge a crowd which had got out of its Chinese
habit of mind, and had found that the world is
wide and that some men are very narrow. And
then the Herald and Telegraph would come out
with huge headings, “Discovery of a New
Continent."" And W. E. Johnson, who is in-
curable, and so would naturally decline to
join the expedition, would write indignantly
to say that there couldn’t be any such
place, and would ask, in impassioned tones,
what was being done about fixing up a Federal
capital on the breezy tableland of Redfern, so
that the “claims” of Macdonald town might be
properly recognised, and Balmain might be com-
pensated for the sacrifices it had made in joining
the Federation, when it might have wrecked
things by standing out along with Pyrmont and
Five Dock.

During the past year the Commissioners
j.f Taxation have tested the accuracy of a
number of tax-payers’ returns by personal
inspection of their accounts, and it is pro-
posed to submit several hundred cases each
year to investigation ■and verification. It is
satisfactory to note that in nearly every in-
stance where the tax has been increased the
reason haa;been explained to the satisfaction
of the taxpayer. Already in numerous
cases persons have, for the first time, an in-
telligent idea of their operations and
financial position, and not a few have ex-
pressed the opinion that this alone goes far
!to recompense them for the trouble each
year in the preparation of the returns.

A Torturing Liver.
“HN EXPERIMENT.”
“The Best Bargain I Ever Made.”
The Case of IVjrs. B. LAWLUJ.
(by a reporter).
The inventions of paper and the press
have put an end to all the restraints with
which our forefathers were fettered, and
they have not only made everyone a writer,
but have also enabled every mind to pour
itself into print and diffuse itself over the
whole intellectual world. The consequences
are inestimable, as, if the slow and laborious
operation of writing on parchment was still
in existence it would be difficult to acquaint
all our readers with such important matters
as are spoken of by Mrs. Bridget Law'ler,
of Northwood-street, Camperdown.
“I was once stricken with a terrible
malady,” began that lady. “It was an
attack of rheumatism which started in my
feet and worked its way into my hands, the
pain being so great that the joints felt as if
they were being screwed round in a vice. I
was very stout when I was first taken ill,
but four years’ intense suffering took all the
flesh off my body, besides making me very
weak and irritable. Some days the pains
were not so bad, while at other times they
were so severe that I was a regular cripple
through them, and could not get out of bed.
At the best my limbs were almost useless,
for I had to go from one room to another
on my hands and knees, so that will tell
you how sorely pressed 1 was.”
“ Did any complications arise?” queried
the newspaper man.
“ They did indeed—any amount of them,
for my system seemed to be upset right
throughout. One of the chief causes of my
weakness was through my food coming back
almost as soon as it was taken, and I hardly
got five respite from 1 etching both
day and night. No wonder, then, that my
eyes felt swollen and that my sight was bad,
and that I used to lie in a state of exhaustion
for hours, with my head pierced by sharp
pains as if rheumatism was there also. Oh !
it was a wretched time for me, and one
which I would not go through again for
thousands of pounds. I thought the vomit-
ing was caused through food being taken
against my inclination, but I was bound to
eat a little sometimes, even though my
appetite was gone, or I would have collapsed
altogether. A heavy kind of pain in the
chest was very troub esoine, too, as it
seemed to weigh me down to such an exteut
that I could not get my bieath properly,
and thoughts of smothering often entered
my mind, although I was not afraid of
doing so in my sleep, because I very rarely
got any. It was quite an extraordinary
event for me to sleep three hours at a time,
and only happened when I was so exhausted
that even my tortures could not keep me
awake any longer ; but for all that I did
not feel rested aftei wards, as the nasty
dreams I had seemed to take away all the
refreshing influences of bleep. When my
eyes opened again I still felt languid and
heavy and so low spirited and desolate that
all brightness seemed to ha\e vanished from
my life. After taking any necessary
nourishment my stomach filled out with
wind, ti’\us bringing into force another dis-
comfort, which frejiiently developed into
pains like the cramps, and lasting till every-
thing, as usual, was vomited. About the
shoulders, too, I had reason to complain
owing to irritating pains getting a hold
there, while nothing could be more un-
welcome than the sickly taste I had in my
mouth every morning, besides having a
whitish coating on my tongue. These
symptoms made me understand very clearly
that my liver was deranged to a serious
degree, and I suppose my doctors knew that
as well, but still I did not benefit my a elf in
any way by remaining under their treat-
ment.”
“ How many doctors did you have ? ”
“ It would be very hard for me to say
exactly. Indeed, I had so many that I
cannot remember them all, and I have no
reason to keen them in mind, because not
one of them did me any good. The more I
went to the worse I got, and then I started
taking advertised pills and medicines, one
particular kii.d of which having such an
injurious effect upon me that after taking a
certain quantity I was almost paralysed < n
one side of my body. There was very little
medicine I had not taken more or less of,
but I was now afraid to resort to any of
them again. I went on in misery for a
while without anything, but, being so help-
less that I could not even handle a cup, I
thought I would never get better that way,
and as I had tried everything but Clements
Tonic it would not ao much harm to see
what that n.edicine was like.""
“ Was your experiment attended with any
better results ? ”
“ It was the best bargain I ever made in
my life when I bought some Clements Tonic,
for there was no uncertainty or indecision
about its action or my internal organs,
which felt its ourative propensities much
more readily than I had deemed possible.
For a long time past my nerves had been
very weak, and I was upset and tremulous
at all sorts of trifling incidents, but that
was one of my troubles which Clements
Tonic remedied straight away. My nervous
system was greatly invigorated after taking
three or four bottles, and then I ceased
meeting difficulties half way, for I was so
much brighter in spirits and more hopeful
through receiving such benefit from
Clements Tonic that I thought I might yet
leave my sufferings behind if I gave that
m ulicine a fair trial. And thus when each
bottle was finished I got another, the
returns for my outlay being a good healthy
appetite and a steady falling off in my
pains. My headaches did not last long
against Clements Tonic, and all the time
my liver symptoms were losing their in-
tensity. 1 slept well at nights, because my
rheumatic pains were less violent, whilst
those about my shoulders aud chest had
left altogether, leaving me to breathe with-
out the least distress. I got up with my
mouth free from its objectionable taste, and
after each meal of the day there was an
absence of flatulence and consequent pains ;
,but to describe each healthful blessing
which came from every bottle of Clements
Tonic would, perhaps, take up too much of
your time. I must content myself by say-
ing that in a few weeks my internal com-
plaints were quite obliterated, and I was
able to get about my work with a cheerful
heart and a contented mind. The
strengthening and disease-removing powers
of Clements Tonic simply astounded me
after the many experiences I had with other
medicines, and I would be very ungrateful
indeed if I kept this knowledge to myself.""
“ Did your various pains leave as quickly
as the rest ? ”
“ No ; but although it took some time to
get me well and strong again in every
resptet there is none the less credit due to
Chments Tonic, as it was the only medicine
which was able to bring me back to health,
and I am willing to let you publish my story
in any way you like.""

THE FOOTBALL TYRANNY.
There is a possibility that militarism will interfere with what is perhaps the most popular intercollegiate event of the year—the annual football contest between St. Peter's
and Prince Alfred Colleges. Almost a tone of alarm at that prospect was sounded by the Head Master of St. Peter’s College (Rev. H. Girdlestone) at a smoke social of old
blues on Friday evening. “All cadets will have to parade for inspection by the Governor-General on the date of this year’s football match. I have written to the military
authorities explaining that the Saturday in question is the only possible date upon which the match can be played, and that it cannot possibly be altered. I have let it rest at
that, but if any of you have any influence with the military I hope you will be able to move them.” (Hear, hear.) —Adelaide paper.

■ Mr. Bruce Smith, M.H.Tt., finds that' he can- -J
nat immediately return to his.legislative duties |
in'Melbourne, in-consequence of the necessity l
for giving some more attention to his pro-
fessional duties during the forthcoming sittings
of the Supreme Court. “It is impossible,” said
Mr. Bruce Smith, when seen in reference to this
matter, “for the representatives of the different
States to give up the whole year to Parliamen-
tary work, to the complete loss of their means
of livelihood; and the country has the Govern-,
mtnt of the Commonwealth to thank for the
boneless muddle into which the business of
Parliament has been thrown.” Mr. Bruce Smith
will arrange a pair during his absence.

THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER.
""Taking an emotional leave of his followers, Mr. Chifley said he would sooner lose his own seat than see any of them lose theirs.’*
“I weep for you,” the walrus said:
“I deeply sympathise.”
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Shells of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

WADE AND THE SPECTRE.
“The principle is dangerous, iniquitous, undemocratic,” said Mr. Wade, with warmth. “The obligation rests on the State Governments to make a move in defence
of constitutional principles, and for the protection of their own rights. I make this fair offer,” Mr. Wade proceeded, “that if Mr. McGowen will take the lead to protect
New South Wales against this gross aggression, I will stand behind him. I beg and implore all business and professional men, and even men of leisure, to consider these
proposals carefully, and when they have mastered the insidious danger that lies beneath them, to use their best endeavors to rouse the public at large to a sense of our im-
pending danger.”— Wade, on the proposal that the people of the Commonwealth shall govern themselves.
McGOWEN: “Now, ought I to humor these diseased fancies of his, or treat him as a dangerous lunatic?”

SYDNEY HAS JUST SURVIVED A HOSPITAL SATURDAY; WHY NOT HAVE A DUKE OF YORK SATURDAY!
Mr. J. D. Hennessey, organising secretary of the Sydney Citizens’ Royal Recep-
tion Committee, on Saturday made the following statement in regard to welcoming the
Royal couple to New South Wales:—“The Duke and Duchess will be here in three
weeks’time. ... If our committee had not been composed of shrewd business men ” [who were
’cute enough to make people’s invitations to the State concert more or less dependent on their
subscriptions to the Reception Fund] “cards of invitation to the State concert might have been
issued promiscuously with but a very poor result in .the shape of donations. To decorate the
Town Hall and make the concert the brilliant functibjx which the occasion demands will require
a large sum of money, while the souvenir to be presented to the Duke is to cost nearly a fourth of
the amount already subscribed. The citizens have had apportioned to them one and a half miles,
to be decorated in some suitable fashion expressive of their spontaneous loyalty to the throne
under wlio.se rule we enjoy great liberty and many national advantages and blessings. Profes-
sional experts and careful business calculation show that for about £lOOO subscribed by the citizens
this distance may be fittingly prepared. Scores of men in Sydney coifld sign a cheque for the
whole amount and never miss the money ; but that would not really meet the case, for the desire
of Dr. Graham and the Citizens’ Committee is to give opportunity to Sydney generally for a
spontaneous welcome to the grandson of Victoria and his Royal spouse.”

""M. Vishinsky, public prosecutor in Moscow, states that the British engineers and mechanics recently arrested have been charged with taking bribes to destroy
electrical power stations in the interests of anti-Communism. The British Cabinet has discussed the question of placing an embargo on all Russian imports after April 17,
following which a severance of diplomatic relations would naturally follow. The view predominates that the arrest of the engineers is a trumped-up affair.”— Cable.

A Champion Athlete
PAYS THE
Penalty for Continuous Training'
And Finds a Welcome Antidote.
The Case of Mr. S. MAHALM.
(FOR THE LEICHHARDT ’'STANDARD.”)
To judge from the numerous successes i»
all kinds of sport which have been, placed
to the credit of Australians it appears that,
as a people, we possess the necessary
stamina and skill required to excel in various
departments of athletics; but, as Mr.
Samuel Mahalm, of Augustus st eet, Leich-
hardt, told our reporter, if is quite possible
to overtax one’s constitution, and then
trouble ensues.
“ In your palmy days as an athlete you
did not think that so much training and
racing was likely to do you harm, I
suppose ? ” remarked a Standard reporter.
*‘l did not give it a thought, to tell you
the truth,” replied Mr. Mahalm. “I was
too enthusiastic in matters of sport to
trouble about the future, but now that I am
all right again I do not regret having in-
dulged in exercise so heavily.”
“It was in rowing that you principally
excel’ed, was it not ? ”
Well, yes; I did meet with a fair
amount of success in that line, as I won the
champion sculls for youths under 21 three
years in succession, and was pitted against
some of the old-time champions beside*. In
running, rowing, and sailing I WO n twenty
races out of twenty-seven starts, so I have
not much to complain about in that respe t,
although, when my health broke down, I
thought the game was not worth the candle,
as the saying goes. It is an awful strain on
one’s system to keep at such heavy v\ ork
continuously, and when I got very ill I
considered that my success was dearly
bought.”
“ What was the first sign you had that
your heal h was breaking down ?”
“ Nervousness. The frequent strains
upon my system had a bad effect on my
nerv s, for they became so unstrung that I
could not keep them steady, and the most
simple thing in the world cou’d give me a
start and make me excited. I went on like
this for a little while, thinking that I would
soon be all right again, when I was greatly
surprised to find that I was suffering from
indigestion. That was an every-day sort of
complaint, I thought, from which some
people suffered severely through not treat-
ing it promptly, and, making up my mind
that I would not make the same mistake, I
started taking medicine for it.”
“Avery sensible procedure,” ejaculated
the scribe.
“It would have been had I known the
proper medicine to take, but I had had no
previous experience, so I to k whatever I
saw advertised, and wlieu one thing did me
no good I tried another, thinking that I
would sure to strike the right one in the
end. Sure enough I did, but it was not till
after enduring several years’intense torture
that a friend advised me to gi\e a trial to
Clements Tonic, but by that time my health
was completely wrecked. The food I per-
suaded myse f to take was harder to digest
than ever, and the after effects were much
more trying. A heavy pain settled on my
chest, which gave me great trouble in
getting my breath, especially at nisjht time,
when I oftm had to sit up in bed, because
I felt as if I would smother if ‘I lay there
any longer, and paroxysms of pain were
caused in my stomach through wind aiising
from the decayed food. By these and other
means I was prevented from obtaining any-
thing like a requisite amount of sleep, the
consequence being that when I ought to have
been leaving my ce 1 I was too dead tired to
do so. I got so miserably weak and low-
spirited that I felt as if I could not speak to
any ody, whilst the mere thought of doing
a little work seerried preposterous, because I
had no vitality in me to doit,. For another
reason I did not like exerting myself. That
was because my heart palpitated and pained
me when I put my body in motion, and I
grew so anxious on that score that I resolved
to take the greatest care of myself and not
throw any chances away. But at last I got
so disheartened that X thought I would never
be well again, a sharp pan catchiDg mo
between the shoulders and across the lower
part of my back, while sometimes I could
scarcely see out of my eyes for the terrible
headaches I had. Vy tongue was in a dis-
agreeable state, being almost white, and
everything I tasted seemed bitter ; not that
I tasted much, as I had no appetite at all.
I could not have sat in a wager boat for the
life of me, as I had turns of giddiness,
whi jh inconvenienced me even when stand-
ing on my fe< t. What had once been hard,
solid flesh became nearly all skin and bone,
so that there was no light task in front of
Clements Tonic when I started taking it.
Another circumstance which I should not
overlook was that I used to have very un-
pleasant dreams on any of those r re
occasions when exhausted nature claimed a
couple of hours’ sleep, so you see what a
perpetual drain there was on my system
through want of proper rest ; and nothing
could ease my pains sufficiently to allow me
to sleep, save Clements Tonic, which gave
me a new feeling of content before the first
week was out. It seemed a marvellous
thing that Clements Tonic could have such
a desirable effect upon me so qui kly, con-
sidering that I had been suffering so long ;
and further use of that me icine showed
that all otlre s were outclass d. The lazy
sense of drowsiness which had made my life
so dreary was given p ace to a feeling of
exhilaration and activity as a result of using
Clements Tonic, whilst that medicine’s
action on my nervous system was more
beneficial than I had ever deemed possible to
be obtained. My nerves became toned to the
state of perfection they were in when I
could go over a three-mile course at a ding-
dong pace ; and I have such a high opinion
of the strengthening qualities of Clements
Tonic that if I were young enough to start
racing again I would take that medicine for
the pur pose of supplying the vitality which
is lost whilst trailring. For putting my in-
ternal organs into a healthy an l machine-
like condition, and driving away headaches,
giddiness and chest pains my acknowledge-
ments go to Clements Tonic, which also
chained my gratitude for remedying the
palpitations and ben t pains,. With'each
bottle of Clements Tonic I came nearer tie
end of my afflictions, for I was eating well
and could digest all manner of food. Windy
spasms and back pains were done away
with by the same medicine, and there was
not an ache left in me. I can frankly
admit that my liver and nerve troubles
were qu te cured by Clements Tonic, and
you can publish all I have said in any way
you think adv’sable.”
“ Thank you,” replied our representative,
“ but it is pro able some of your old friends
already know this experience of yours.”
“ Some do, I know; but I can’t tell all of
them, as I know *.o many th ough living in
this suburb twenty years, while for the last
five years I have been proprietor of the
Leichliard. Swimming Baths.”

“A public meeting, to consider the conduct of Messrs. J. P. Garvan and J. P. Abbott in accepting from Sir Henry Parkes the appointment of Convention delegates without consulting the
Protection leader, Mr. G. R. Dibbs, or the Protection Opposition in Parliament, was held in the Temperance-hall last flight. Mr. G. Hawkins moved-'That owing to the treacherous conduct of
Messrs. J. P. Abbott and J. P. Garvan, M’s.P., in accepting State offices from a Freetrade Government have forfeited the confidence of all consistent and honest Protectionists, and this
meeting pledges itself to nominate candidates and oppose both gentlemen whenever they offer themselves for reflection.' Mr. R. F. Norman seconded the motion, which was carried.""-Daily Paper.

Mr. Garrard (Minister for Education
and Labor) said it was c'sar the gardens
had not been managed on business lines,
and the proposal to give the society another
£ 1000 could not be reasonably entertained.
The more successful the Sunday opening
of the gardens was, the more Sunday labor
would be required in working
the trams. On that ground
alone he would oppose the
motion. Call him a Sabba-
. tarian or call him what they
liked, he would never be a
party to any arrangement
which might eventually mean
more extended infringement of
the Sunday liberty of workers.

year had been imported we should have
had £357,000 import duty. _ -

looked at him, and
said ; “ What are you

And they went away
and smiled.
And there w£re only he and the vacant sea line.
He never did any work, but waited on there,
and got thinner and colder.. ,

a sheet of - bark, and said : “ Why
don’t .you cover yourself? This ’ere

sugar for me! I want that

Price, (sd.
A number of clergymen, ladies, and laymen
had meantime assembled in the Executive cham-
ber. This was the most formidable deputation
of the three. Mr. BrUnker knew most of them.
He was cheerd when he entered the room. In /
response he shook several of the gentlemen by, '
the hand.
The
speakers dwelt on the importance of Sunday as a
day of rest, and attributed the greatness of Eng-
land to It.
Mr. Brunker expressed his entire sympathy
with the deputation. If the working classes
were deprived of their day of rest, it was hard
to predict what the result would be. He hoped
that this country would yet become as great as
the dear old land. And it could do so onlf by a
Close observance of the Sunday. He hope# that
the rising generation would always be taught to
observe not only the laws of their counttfaF but
tho laws of God. Vt

* BATHURST, Tuesday .-—A number of burglaries
havs been committed recently in the outskirts
of the town. The police are unable to detect
the offenders. A few nights ago a burglar
coolly entered the house of a gaol whrder during
the absence of the man and his wife. A young
child had been left in the house while the
Darents were absent, and it being disturbed by
Use arrival of the burglar began crying but
the intruder pacified it by supplying it with lol-
lies which he found during the search. Before
completing his search for plunder he was disturb-
ed, and cleared out, having secured some money.

Miss Maud Fitz-Stubbs, assisted by Mrs. Frank
Blayden, gave a piano recital of her new waltz,
""The Premier,” at Paling’s rooms, yesterday
afternoon. There was a large attendance, Includ-
ing the Premier (Mr. Reid), to whom the waltz Is
dedicated. Since her celebrated ""Heather,” Miss
Fitz-Stubbs has not written such an acceptable
and brilliant waltz as the present one. The
themes are melodious, of agreeable rhythmical
variety, and sonorously harmonised. ""The Pre-
mier” will prove a great favorite in the ball-
room.

W. E. Johnson, M.H.R., has written to the Sydney papers urging that a winter picnic should be organised to the selected Federal at Dalgety,
in order that people may realise the full horror of the climate. As part of the proposed Canberra site (for which Mr. Johnson barraks) is 250ft.
higher than Dalgety, The Bulletin hastens to supply a winter picture of Johnson’s own site as it will doubtless appear to Johnson swi imagina ion.
(N.B.-The figure being pursued by the Canberra polar bear is meant for Johnson.)

Ye Country Editor
For The Bulletin
‘ The duties of a country editor are onerous
indeed.”—Brisbane Paper.
I am a country editor ;
In weekly prose I rage and roar,
In weekly verse I sigh and soar,
And weekly articles I dress in various guises,
grave and gay ;
I tell the tale of local needs,
Of local guzzles, hops and feeds,
Of fearsome fights and darksome'deeds,
And oft-times do I gently chide the free and festive
M.L.A.
Tis mine when Muggins drains a bog
Or weans a calf or slays a hog,
Or stands the editorial grog,
To cry, The country's safe again—a Muggins to
the rescue—ho ! ”
’Tis mine when Juggins' twins are born
To loudly toot the local horn
And wake the echoes of the morn
By crying loud : “ Ye scoffing crowd—behold the
might of Juggins Joe I ""
’Tis mine to tell how Buggins’ bier
Was borne, bedewed with many a tear,
Away from all who held him dear
, To where the marble tombstones rise, and where
the cypress branches wave ;
And how by chance it there befel
That certain mourners liquored well,
And started then (for grief will tell)
With frantic din (ah, me—the sin !) a furious dog.
fight o’er the grave.
I chronicle the monster spud ;
I tell of horrid deeds of blood.
Of men who fall with sickening thud,
Of burglars bad who nightly pad and purses pick
and raise your hair ;
And when the gruesome day is done,
And sinks the sanguinary sun,
I sheathe my knife and plant my gun,
And hide with haste my pot of pas to, and seek my
dark and distant lair.
THE COUNTRY EDITOR.
P. LUFTIG.

THE GRAVE OF GOVERNOR PHII.fF
The Revi,:F. B. Boyce received by the last m*i|
th» following letter from the Vicar of Bathamp.
■ ton,. Bath, the Rev. L. J. Fish, relative to tlj*
discovery of Governor Phillip’s grave. He says-
—""l read of you as being one of the pioneers t»
a proper appreciation of Phillip and his wonder,
tul work, and so I venture to write to you con-
ceming the discovery In our church of his grave.
The fact I made public In a letter to 'The Times'
of November 3. although the colony had official
Intimation of the fact first by wire, and then by
letters. I am now much concerned at the very
unworthy memorial of him which the present
grave presents to Australians and others who
have already begun to visit this church to see
where he lies.

He. had never concealed from himself the
thanks he owned to the labor party for the part
they had played. There would be good feeling-
.-between the two.parties as long as the Govern.-
Went honestly tried to carry out its pledges
when they failed to do that it was time for
everybody to fall out with them.
The freetrade party and the labor
party were at one in their belief in broad and
liberal principles, and it was the game of the
latter to get the Government to go faster than
they would otherwise go. The only difference
between the parties was that the labor party was
more prepared than the Other, to makp ran id
changes and rapid developments.

“Replying to a suggestion by Mr. Doe that, as N.S.W. money would go into the Federal Loan of £5,100,000 for the benefit of the other States, N.S.W should raise a
local loan at the same time, Mr. Lang said that N.S.W. did not need money, and he had no intention of competing with the other States.”
DOE: “Come on, Lang; if we don’t get our share, they’ll drink it all.”

we’re trying to get it on our own account in England. But what do you offer us 1 You haven't got any sort of big manufactures and no
decent land open. It’s no good coming out here to be unemployed or to half-starve out in the dry country. Give us a factory, or a bit of

“The most serious problem facing the N.S.W. Composite Ministry, which took office this week, is finance. It is estimated that to carry on Public Works in

charge of Local Government has had to refuse all appeals for new works, and the funds available for the relief of the unemployed will be exhausted by the end of the
week.”
